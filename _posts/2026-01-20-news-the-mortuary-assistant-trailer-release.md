The trailer has been released for The Mortuary Assistant movie adaptation, and it looks damn good. Originally released on Steam on August 2, 2022,  Brian Clarke's The Mortuary Assistant was developed by DarkStone Digital and published by DreadXP. It quickly earned a well-deserved reputation as one of the scariest horror games of the year.

You play as Rebecca Owens, a newly hired assistant at a haunted mortuary... a setting that feels tailor-made for horror. Your job involves performing the mundane but unsettling tasks required to process the recently deceased: draining blood, sewing mouths and eyes shut, and preparing bodies for cremation. The catch is that one of the bodies is possessed by a demon, and Rebecca must perform the correct exorcism to survive.

The film adaptation stars Willa Holland as Rebecca, best known for her roles in The O.C. and Arrow. It’s being released by the same studio responsible for the Terrifier franchise, which suggests the movie won’t shy away from the violence and disturbing imagery fans have come to expect from the game. It's directed by Jeremiah Kipp [Slapface] and written by Tracee Beebe and Brian Clarke himself.

While the game itself is relatively short, its procedurally generated storyline and evolving paranormal events give it strong replay value. That structure seems well-suited for a one-off horror film. The trailer looks appropriately grisly and appears to remain faithful to the source material. If you’re a fan of the game, this is definitely one to keep on your radar. The film is set for release on February 13, 2026.
