> Bendy And The Ink Machine starts out innocently enough, but as you progress it ramps up surrealism in an already surreal world and takes you down a dark, ink stained path!

When I first started playing my initial thought was that it looks like a low key Borderlands style walking sim. The further I got you really start to appreciate the charm of the art style and it sweeps you up into a 1940's style of cartoon horror to the likes of which we haven't really seen. (At least not until this and Cuphead) As I progressed through the true breadth of the game is revealed. There's a lot to dissect and much of the lore is provided via audio recordings.I won't post any spoilers, but there's enough there to hold your attention. Everything culminates at the end and you're left with a decent "thinker" of an ending and a nice incentive to play again.

The sound for the most part was on point. It never took me out of the setting and the design was solid pretty much throughout. You're provided some very atmospheric levels and decent jumpscares when you're least expecting it. They never felt overly cheap. There are also portions that have some great tension. The puzzles were actually a lot of fun! Each time I encountered one, I found myself eager to figure it out. Rarely a dull moment, but some backtracking in a couple levels might push some folks away. As for the Horror elements, it's there, but it's more of a lighthearted Horror. Don't get me wrong, there are genuine scares in this game. But sometimes, it's accompanied with very lovable characters such as Boris The Wolf!

One thing that really bugged me about the game was the combat... it's pretty bad. When you're given the opportunity to fight, it's basically just exchanging blows until your foe goes down. Your character moves (runs) so slow it borders on obnoxious. At first it didn't seem like a problem because the combat is scarce. Further along you see it becomes a bit more vital and for one scene in particular, I was starting to get a touch annoyed because you're in a "wave by wave of enemies" situation. Boss fights often had me scratching my head, but one you figure it out, it's fun and pretty easy.

This game has been out long enough that it goes on sale fairly regularly. I'd wait for a sale if you can. Once you get it, I don't think you'll regret it! I certainly don't!

**Score: 4.5/6**
