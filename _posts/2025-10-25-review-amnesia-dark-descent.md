Is amnesia the dark decent still worth playing in 2026? I mean, it's a 16 year old game at this point, so it's already able to get a driver's license and is only 2 years off from seeing the latest rated R horror movie in theater. Released in September of 2010, and developed by Fictional Games, this title has been the backdrop of many content creators as viewers flocked to their channels to see the scares. And it's got the reviews to back it up. It's currently sitting at a overwhelmingly positive place on the overall reviews, but the recent reviews have dropped down to "mostly positive"... What's happened with this game?

If you're at all into horror, you have likely already heard of amnesia the dark decent. It's sold over 1 million copies since it's release and has since been released on multiple platforms. For those who don't know, you play as Daniel (just Daniel... Like Madonna) who's just awoken in Brennenberg Castle in Prussia with total amnesia (get it?) as to how you ended up there. You navigate the castle finding various items that steadily bring you up to speed. Certain visuals and items trigger auditory flashbacks which fill your head in certain areas, while other areas have hand written in the notes of the accounts leading up to the amnesia incident. It's up to you to find out what exactly happened. But there's a catch... While traversing the castle, an unknown horror is stalking your every move.

## Experience & Atmosphere

The setting couldn't be creepier. The castle is huge and has many rooms to explore showing what should've been a bustling setting, is instead eerily vacant. Wind blows through the corridors, and darkness fills the halls. Your own actions are the only sound that echos throughout the castle as you find piece after piece of your memory. It gives liminal spaces vibe for the medieval era.

But even so, not every area is grand and open. The game does its fair share of claustrophobia inducing levels as you climb into small holes in the walls, enclosed corridors, and crawl through tight tunnels. You'll explore jail cells and chambers that hold the spirits brought upon by unsavory actions.

And here's the best part; you have a sanity level that affected by supernatural events, looking at the grunt, and darkness and you have limited light as a resource. Daniel has a lantern which uses oil, and oil is in short supply and high demand. Lose your sanity and only bad things can happen. On a standard playthrough, you fall to the floor incapacitated and make a ton of noise alerting the ever-stalking monster. Which will probably lead to death. If you're on hardcore, then you lose your sanity you die... full stop.

## Gameplay & Mechanics

I have a lot of good to say about the game, but with every game there were definitely some problems. There was one issue with an element of the game that occurred a handful of times.

In this game you have the ability to interact with almost any loose object. A mouse 1 while hovering allows you to pick up the item and throw it, or whatever you want. Now, this is fine, but halfway through the game and it decides that now this type of interaction is a game mechanic that is required to progress.

Everything to that point was you get an object in your inventory and then could use it from a prompt or similar. It was a bit of a frustration point because at some moments there was no way to tell whether you're required to pick up the item physically or pick it up in your inventory. It made it confusing at a couple of points because you don't know if you're pursuing the right one.

## Audio

The audio is really well done and there weren't many times, if any that you'll was taken out of the game because of what you're hearing. Every setting matched the audio well. Big open areas reverberated your footsteps, and had wind howling through and creaks heard throughout. Tighter spaces felt more closed in. Rooms with clutter had deadened sound leading to quieter moments in the game.

The castle is also filled with ghostly whispers and auditory hallucinations experienced by Daniel, which definitely adds to the tension and creep factor. The voice acting was also well done. Especially on the grunt who will absolutely horrify you when you're being chased.

## Verdict

The ending is interesting, but leads to another issue that feels a bit uninspired. There will be no spoilers here, but after the ending you get an achievement. Checking the achievements you see there are other achievements to get at the same point. So naturally you reload and get those achievements, because why not? You don't want to go back and play through the entire game just to experience what would happen had you had just interacted differently with the end encounter.

And that's the point. There isn't too much for replayability aside from wanting to experience the horror again! Which in itself is great for a horror game. I can see myself revisiting Castle Brennan erg at some point. However, there's no alternative routes to take or anything, so the multi-ending situation felt more like an afterthought.

It doesn't detract from the game whatsoever, but what you choose to do in the moment you might want to take as your "Canon moment" because with all the info you have, and what you see before you, it's up to you to decide how you'll react in the final act.

So what's happened with the game and why have the reviews slipped from overwhelmingly positive to mostly positive on Steam? Well, a quick look shows that many recent players are taking issue with the graphics. You have to admit at this point in time, they do feel dated... but the reality is the game is dated.

At 16 years old at the time of this review, it's easy to view it as such when you have modern day horror games like Resident Evil pushing realism more than ever before.

So should you play Amnesia: The Dark Decent in 2026? If you frequent /r/patientgamers and still find yourself booting up some of the classic horror games, then absolutely you will enjoy playing it. If you're only really interested in the latest and greatest with tons of realism and top notch graphics, you can give this one a pass.

**Score: 5.5/6**
