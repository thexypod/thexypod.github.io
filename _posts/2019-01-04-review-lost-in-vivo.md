> A horror game with a big, cold, black and bleeding heart! This game need to be celebrated as an outstanding addition to the horror genre.

This showed up in my queue and seeing as it had "overwhelmingly positive" reviews at the time, I checked it out on a whim. I'm a big Silent Hill fan so the first thing I noticed was the similarities in the trailer. When you start the game you'll probably notice the graphics right away. It looks dated and I'll admit at first, it was a bit of a turn off. However, as you progress through the game, you start to notice that it is all a part of the charm. I felt myself whisked back to early days of gaming. You're walking your dog down the street when a sudden storm comes through and your dog gets caught up in the flood waters and is sucked down a sewer drain. You follow down into the sewer and begin your pursuit. Then you feel it... there is something very, very, sinister happening here.

I won't get into spoiler territory, but I will say this: You can tell almost right away the amount of love that was put into this game. It's just such a solid experience that I can't recommend it enough. Sure, the combat mechanics aren't the greatest, and a couple times I found myself in situations where I had no idea what I was supposed to do. But those negatives are greatly outweighed by the positives. I found myself wanting to investigate EVERYTHING in game, and regretting taking that right when there was a left I could've gone down. It makes for some excellent replayability. I also should note the audio... it was actually very immersive and very well designed. Combined with some of the mechanics of the game, and the Akira Yamaoka Silent Hill inspired soundtrack, it all adds into something special. I was streaming the game at the time of my playthrough and was fortunate to have someone who had been down the "Lost In Vivo" rabbit hole before. They showed me some of the Easter eggs and features in the game that while simple, added so much more heart to the game. I was almost sad to see it end.

So in summary, if you're into the atmosphere of Silent Hill, find charm in intentionally dated graphics, enjoy surreal gaming experiences leaving you in a total WTF headspin, or any of the above... you're going to love this game!

**Score: 5/6**
