Just before the new year I committed myself to finally going down the rabbit hole that is the Amnesia franchise. I started with [The Dark Descent](https://thexypod.com/review-amnesia-dark-descent), a game that I had multiple start-stops with because I just wasn’t feeling it initially. Ultimately, I decided to stream it since there have been very few games that I haven’t finished while streaming. With the added commitment, I finished and loved it. I followed it up with The Bunker since there was little to no connection with the first game and it fell into one of my favorite horror games of all time. So, I took a little break and played [Greyhill Incident](https://thexypod.com/review-greyhill-incident), [Unmourned](https://thexypod.com/review-unmourned), and [BrokenLore: UNFOLLOW](https://thexypod.com/review-brokenlore-unfollow)... Amnesia kept gnawing at me to jump back in. The next choice was obvious… Rebirth!

## Overview
You begin the game in the perspective of Tasi who is on a plane with her husband Salamin. He’s nervous as you fly over the desert. As you comfort him, his fears come to fruition as the plane encounters the worst case scenario and crash lands on the dunes of Algeria. Luckily, (or not) the majority of the passengers survive. Tasi wakes inside the wrecked plane to discover not only are her memories of events following the crash gone, the entire remaining crew of survivors are missing as well.

With nothing but a couple of notes and clues, Tasi begins her journey from the dunes into the nearby caves.

## Gameplay & Mechanics
Rebirth plays quite similarly to TDD, but more polished. It could be argued that Rebirth feels more like an Amnesia game than The Bunker. You have your standard inventory, click to manipulate, crouch, walk, run, and lighting things on fire for illumination and lowering fear levels with your matches. Rebirth adds the ability of a “hit the floor” ability by holding down the crouch button. This makes you even smaller of a target for maximum stealth. You’re immobile during this, and much harder to spot.

At the beginning of the game, you’re given a “compass” used to locate and open portals between worlds. At first, it feels like it will be a vital mechanic throughout the experience, but it ultimately becomes more of an occasional tool sprinkled in to move the story forward. In practice, it feels underutilized, and the game may have been better off without it entirely.

You’re also given a lamp that serves as your primary light source between manually lit torches. It prevents your fear from rising, which is essential, but its hunger for lamp oil can feel a bit excessive, often forcing you into darker moments. Thankfully, when you do find yourself in complete darkness, your in-game eyes will gradually adjust after a few seconds, allowing you to see where you’re going. That said, fear begins to climb during these moments, encouraging you to keep them as brief as possible.

Instead of a sanity meter, the game uses a fear level which, while similar, has its own distinct properties. As with sanity systems, fear is communicated through auditory and visual cues, but Rebirth goes a step further by introducing brief, cryptic visions that don’t make sense at first but gradually click as you progress. When your fear peaks, or you succumb to an enemy, a cutscene plays and you find yourself back in a previously visited location, leaving you to question what just happened. Fear can be reduced by standing in lit areas created using the plentiful matches found throughout the levels if you look hard enough. There’s one additional fear-reducing mechanic introduced after the halfway point that’s best left unmentioned due to spoilers, but it’s genuinely unique and unlike anything typically seen in games, let alone horror.

The puzzles strike a great balance. There’s very little hand-holding, but you won’t be stuck for long if you use your noggin. Clues are scattered around each puzzle, not as explicit “do this” instructions, but as vague hints describing what’s been tried before and what’s worked.

You’re also unlikely to encounter many bugs if any. From start to finish Rebirth offers a full experience with a handful of load times. Each chapter is compartmentalized, but does feel like it belongs.

## Experience & Atmosphere
If you’re fresh off the heels of TDD, you’ll find that the “feel” of Rebirth has pretty much done a copy + paste here. This isn’t to say that it’s bad in any way, it’s just that Frictional Games had found a working model with TDD, and refined it.

You may find that the beginning of the game is a touch slow as it takes its time establishing the story and characters. Take your time here. The game starts out by asking the player not to “play to win” and you should heed the warning. Rebirth serves its purpose and will reward those looking to get into a deep and meaningful story rather than playing a game and being good at it. That being said there isn’t anything overtly challenging in the game aside from a few puzzles. With Rebirth, it’s better to evade as best you can, solve the puzzles, and just enjoy the story.

The second half of the game is where the meat resides. It takes you through sequences of surreal areas where you're faced with elements of adventure, sci-fi, and horror all wrapped into a solid experience. No spoilers here but some of the encounters will have your heart beating right out of your chest. There are some chase scenes in the game that are some of the best seen in horror games. The enemies don’t exactly vary, but the settings do make each encounter unique.

When it comes to stealth, this game seems to have it nailed down tight. As mentioned, there is the added “hit the floor" mechanic that, while seemingly simple, helps to build the tension even further. Once you’re down, the field of view narrows significantly leaving only audio clues to determine the threat. There's more than a few moments where you'll be holding your breath along with Tasi trying to evade the monsters. The monsters are almost taken directly out of the movie The Descent, so if you've seen that, you can prepare to live it in the game… caving included!

By the final act of the game, you might start to feel like the ending is overstaying its welcome a bit. Having done all the puzzles, and navigated through most of the story, you arrive at a part that feels like it’s about to crescendo into the ending only to be met with more gameplay, puzzles, and hiding. If this portion was devoid of it, it would have been a more natural progression to the end. It’s not particularly long, but that in itself should tell you how irrelevant this part of the game is.

## Story & Narrative
Rebirth has a story that has a ton of emotional weight as far as a horror game is concerned. The dread you feel as you navigate through this desolate sandscape is compounded by the past and present (and oncoming) trauma that Tasi is facing through the game. Tasi has already suffered great tragedy in her life and every chapter of the game forces her to face an aspect of her life that would be better forgotten if they could, but is impossible given the nature of them. Her story is utterly heartbreaking.

You’ll be surprised to learn that despite being separated by 100 years in game time, the storyline does a really great job of expanding on the lore of TDD. There are both subtle nods as well as clues that directly tie the two games together. It really leans into the background of vitae and Tasi finds herself wrapped in what its existence really means. All this is to say, you should complete TDD before diving into Rebirth. It’s not 100% necessary. If you don’t you won’t particularly miss out on anything, but if you do, you’ll appreciate the connections that much more.

There aren’t many decisions to be made in Rebirth as the story is fairly linear. As in TDD, there are multiple endings that are available starting from a specific moment. This means you’ll be able to save and try each one of them out at the end… However, there is a “secret” good ending that you can achieve by not dying in the game more than 3 times. It’s a tall order, but if you can do it, it’s a respectable achievement. Either way, this story has tragedy written all over it and could leave you feeling a little empty despite doing the “right thing”.

## Audio & Visual
Frictional Games is considered an indie studio, but you would never be able to tell from the latest releases. Rebirth adds to their repertoire with a lot of style and grace on both the auditory and visual fronts.

The audio is spot on at every moment. From the very first scene of the plane crash, you’re instantly immersed into the world of Rebirth and it only gets better as you play. The voice acting is nothing short of incredible and adds to the emotional punch that the game has clearly established. Even when confronted with monsters, the audio is constantly bringing tension with both the atmospheric audio and the jumpscare sounds. All this is paired with the atmospheric music that has been a staple in every Amnesia title.

The visuals don’t leave anything to be desired and some of the scenes venture into the surreal. While the graphics aren’t as life-like as some more recent AAA titles, there are some truly breathtaking scenes. The models and textures are expertly crafted. Their disfigured bodies paired with the audio is sure to leave you wincing as you play. There are few (if any) moments where you’ll find the visuals don’t align with the rest of the game.

## Verdict
Rebirth, for one reason or another, has taken some flak from fans of the earlier games, hovering around the mid-70s on Steam. Common criticisms point to the frequent flashbacks and a sense that the experience feels overly scripted. I don’t agree, and consider it one of the stronger entries in the series. While the first half can feel a bit dry, relying heavily on notes and memories for exposition, and the gameplay does occasionally feel “on rails,” these elements serve a purpose. The flashbacks in particular do an excellent job of setting up the final acts, where the horror is dialed up to eleven. In that sense, Rebirth unfolds more like an interactive novel… an approach I found surprisingly refreshing.

If anything I found Rebirth to be as good if not better than TDD. The story holds more weight in the decisions you make, packs a broader, more emotional punch, and has refined all the elements of TDD that make it feel dated. If you’re a parent then I think the story will resonate with you that much more as themes of parenthood are present throughout. Just be warned, there could be some trigger points for players who have experienced loss first hand.

Rebirth may not be the Amnesia game everyone wanted, but it’s very much the one Frictional Games set out to make. For those willing to meet it on its own terms, it’s an experience that lingers long after the credits roll.

**Score: 5.5/6**
