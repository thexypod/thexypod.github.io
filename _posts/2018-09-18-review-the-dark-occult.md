Coming from Rym Games, a small outfit from Morocco, it succeeds in bringing true paranormal scares and atmosphere. It plays a bit like Outlast mixed with Fatal Frame and maybe even a bit of Silent Hill. You journey through a house that is plagued with a history of the occult, rituals, sacrifices, and just overall awful things as you try to locate your friends & colleagues. Solve puzzles, find keys and items to progress… while it doesn’t bring anything new to the table in terms of survival horror gameplay, when the formula works… Jump scares aplenty, but they’re all well timed and never feel overstated. At the time of writing this, I have roughly 7 hours into it and I find myself excited to continue my search.

The graphics have a fresh feel which is hard to describe. It just doesn’t look like many games out there and that’s a good thing. The characters within the game seem to have a “weight” to them. The house feels like it was once a beautiful estate with a grand history, but abandoned some time ago. The attention to detail shows here as each room is well detailed with furniture and items… it never feels empty and definitely helps to keep you immersed in the environment.

The voice acting leaves a bit to be desired, but the instances are few and far between so it doesn’t take you out of the atmosphere very often. The sounds are very well designed and stay in line with the experience. I don’t like that the sound drops out when you’re in a menu… that does tend to take you out of the world a bit. Considering it’s the old style of you die often, so save often in the style of Resident Evil, you’re in a menu quite a bit. I’ve noticed the odd hiccup of perhaps placeholder sounds that were never finished, again, not enough to warrant a bad review.

Speaking of reviews, as some of the reviews are saying, I have encountered a couple of bugs, which is unfortunate since it's not considered early access. I’ve fallen through the floor into a different place in the house, been attacked through walls, those kinds of bugs. But the team says they're on it so hopefully they get squashed quick. Some of the translations seem off, never anything to make it impossible to understand. Otherwise, aside from having to reload once and it getting a touch "framey" at times I haven't encountered anything that doesn't let me progress. For the price, I highly recommend this game!

EDIT: The first 5-10 hours are as I stated above, but the game then loses focus. As the house opens up to you, the following hours are spent looking for item after item to unlock... MORE ITEMS! This makes me not recommend it because these items aren't presented to you in any linear fashion. Their all scattered throughout the house in areas you would/should have thought you already explored. The house is worse than a maze as the hallways mostly look the same. Couple that with the fact that you don't get a map and no indications of where keys unlock certain doors and you're left backtracking and trying doors multiple times. Many of the later game puzzles become more of a chore lacking any mechanics to give you even the slightest hints of what you should be doing or where you should be going. By the end of the game, I was too frustrated with the process to even care, and without spoiling it, the end is pretty lackluster.

All in, it might be worth it if it's on sale. It genuinely has some really awesome and truly scary parts to it, but you might find the entire thing a touch more tedious than you think as you venture through.

2/6
