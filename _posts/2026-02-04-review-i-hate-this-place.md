I found “I Hate This Place” while researching my video, [66 Horror Games Coming In 2026 and Beyond](https://thexypod.com/news-66-horror-games-coming-in-2026) and it immediately stood out to me. The style, the setting, the music was all fairly unique from the other titles on the list. When it was finally released I found myself excited to jump in despite the game hovering around the “mixed” mark on Steam. So, how does IHTP shape up in this year of amazing horror?

## Overview
In IHTP, you take control of Elena in an isometric, comic book styled view. Elena and her friend Lou are travelling to Elena’s old family homestead to find info on her missing mother. Lou prepares a ritual to call on The Horned Man to aid them in their search. Something goes awry with the ritual and Lou goes missing. Elena begins her journey back to homestead alone with resolving the disappearances of Lou and her mother being her main objective.

A cult has taken up residence in the area and to make matters even worse, hostile monsters have begun appearing across the land. In Elena’s quest for the truth she gets tangled in something much bigger than she could’ve anticipated.

## Gameplay & Mechanics
With its top down isometric view the game plays a bit like a more actionable Project Zomboid. The map has locations in every cardinal direction with distinct characteristics such as the ranch, a swamp, the fields, and a forest. You’re able to quick-travel to these locations via boat by locating and unlocking the dock locations. This does take in-game time meaning you may arrive at night having left in the afternoon.

The game features melee, ranged, throwables, health, stamina, and satiety. One immediate issue is the game’s control scheme. Melee attacks use Mouse 1, ranged attacks require aiming with Mouse 2 then firing with Mouse 1, health and satiety items are cycled with “1” and used with “spacebar,” and throwables are cycled with “2” and thrown with “F.” If it sounds confusing, that’s because it is. This convoluted setup could have been simplified with a standard action bar, but the situation is made worse by the fact that none of these actions are remappable, forcing players to navigate an awkward and clunky system throughout the game.

Stealth is your main ally as you get your bearings. As you move, color coded comic-book-style captions appear with each step, showing the noise you’re making. From quiet green “thuds” to loud red markers when stepping on glass (“crunch”) or mud and organic matter (“squelch”). Enemies use a detection system that works almost like a three-strike rule fitting with the baseball bat motif. Make too much noise, and they’ll be alerted; rack up three strikes, and they lock onto you. At that point, it’s your choice: fight or flee. If you opt to escape, make sure your stamina is topped up.

The fighting feels good when you attack, but getting hit feels a little loose. There’s no on-screen indication when you’re hit, and even worse when you’re running low on health. It would be advantageous to have some sort of border, or noise when you’re nearing death. This can lead to some disappointing deaths because you were focused more on the combat than your health bar. A few UI tweaks from the devs would remedy this immediately.

You’ll also have to contend with your stamina which determines how fast you can swing your bat and how much you’re able to run. The stamina is then tied to your satiety. This is probably one of the weaker elements of the game. For other survival games it makes sense, especially when it’s a longer sandbox game. IHTP tries to come off as a survival driven game, but it becomes more of a nuisance than anything as you’re constantly reminded about how you have to eat. But not to worry, because…

Crafting in IHTP also feels like an unnecessary addition. On the ranch, you can build structures based on blueprints you find throughout the game. These structures then generate items used in crafting, but in a relatively short 5-10 hour playthrough, you’ll quickly accumulate more resources than you could ever need. While the system itself is well designed, it lacks meaningful impact. It’s a neat feature on paper, but it doesn’t add enough depth to justify its presence. This is compounded by the fact that the frequent bunker explorations yield an abundance of supplies, further removing any sense of scarcity and making the entire crafting loop feel redundant. 

Unfortunately the crafting menu also has a few bugs where the text is blacked out until it is moused over and the “new” icon displays every time the menu is brought up. You might find that you’re missing some vital materials only to discover they were craftable but hidden by this bug.

## Experience & Atmosphere
The overarching theme of the game is akin to an 80s cult & body horror movie. There are three distinct themes for the game. The open world area, the ghost dimensions, and the bunkers.

The main open world is done well, though it does feel a little small. When you’re hearing stories from people within the area, they give accounts with this small town feel. But the map itself seems to be missing this actual town. It does have a day/night cycle with night being more populated with hostile monsters and the scary sounds that come with them, so it’s got a lot more tension than the daytime.

The ghost stories have you in this ethereal, surreal feel to them. The weapons and items take a backseat and you’re instead equipped with a special flashlight that you can use to vanquish any foes by shining it upon them, not that there’s many. The sole purpose of these areas is to gain insight on the lore of the area through the mishaps of its residents. You need to collect evidence and report your findings back to the game to escape.

The bunkers have a tense, almost sci-fi feel, with claustrophobic corridors packed full of monsters. The layouts and scattered notes hint at a highly secretive, militaristic operation conducting disturbing experiments. These areas form the core of the game, each similar in overall design but with unique paths and puzzle-like navigation that keeps you on edge as you move through them.

Being top-down makes it hard for most games to deliver genuine scares, but IHTP manages a few memorable moments. These shocks are usually brief, and by the final act they become far less frequent, but their imagery and style are striking, often catching you completely off guard.

## Story & Narrative
Elena goes on her search for her mother and really stumbles on an escalating situation occurring around the homestead. Her quest takes you to different places where you meet different people who ask for your help in exchange for further information about either Lou, the area, the cult, or Elena’s family. It’s an interesting web in which each group plays a role.

As you progress you learn more about the cult and the people that run it as well as its members. More importantly, you learn about the cult’s deity the Horned Man who is the central focus of the entire game. He has a role to play in every aspect of the game and it’s up to Elena to figure out how it’s all connected. Luckily there are a handful of NPCs to guide your path… if you’re able to find them (see verdict).

Without spoiling anything, the ending doesn’t exactly “stick the landing”. You arrive at a loot-filled final location, as if gearing up for some epic showdown… and then nothing. Your “choices” for the conclusion are basically column A or column B. To top it off, a game breaking bug hits right after the last playable scene. There’s a bit of an exposition dump and it’s a glitchy mess where the cutscenes jump forward repeatedly interrupting and overlapping the dialog. Once it’s complete, you’re immediately taken back to the main menu with no credit sequence where you’re left wondering, “is that it!?”

## Audio & Visual
The audio generally comes together nicely, with professional sound effects that help ground the action. There are a few moments where the mix fails, usually with dialogue getting overpowered by environmental noise or music, but captions are almost always available, so you’re never lost. The voice acting fits the game’s angsty tone, though there were occasional mismatches between dialogue and captions that could be a little confusing if you’re reading along.

Visually, IHTP shines. It’s based on the comic book of the same name and it’s designed to have a comic book look and feel to it with a nice blend of 80s style and VHS qualities. The comic book style is consistent throughout, with bold lines and stark contrasts. The style gives the game a unique identity which is a refreshing break from the usual dark, hyper-realistic horror aesthetics.

The music has an 80s synthwave vibe that fits the theme and the sci-fi elements. It's not necessarily added to create tension, though a few moments do have a bit. There are some contemplative tracks that play nicely with some of the moments in the game. It could use a little more in spots all things considered.

## Verdict
I genuinely enjoyed my time with this game, despite a few frustrating issues… many of which feel like UI misfires. For example, I didn’t realize until I was about 80% through the game that the quest menu had multiple pages. Until then, it seemed like the quest objectives were never updated. Once I figured that out, it became clear how the game directs you: clicking on a quest objective will highlight the associated location on your map.

That said, the game can be punishing if you miss certain areas. There’s a nondescript section of the map containing a pivotal interaction required to progress. If you overlook it, you simply can’t move forward. With the game giving me nothing to hint at its importance, I was left completely baffled, wandering and unsure what to do next. It definitely feels like a design oversight that could’ve used a light nudge to ensure the interaction took place..

Even with these issues, the core gameplay is engaging and satisfying. The pacing and action kept me invested, and the story is intriguing for the most part. But the ending is underwhelming. After carefully exploring and experiencing the game’s systems, the payoff felt lackluster, leaving the final moments focused on generic enemy encounters rather than a memorable climax. While horror games don’t always need a grand finale, when the action mechanics are central to the experience, the ending should deliver more than what’s here.

**Score: 2.5/6**
