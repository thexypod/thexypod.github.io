Let me start out this review by saying I am a Blair Witch fan through and through. I loved the movies, I took part in the ARG that was initially released. I was excited for this game... But ultimately, I was disappointed.

With the above considered, let me say that they didn't take advantage of the rich lore that was a part of the Blair Witch Project. Just taking the first 20 minutes of the movie leaves you with plenty of lore in which to base this game off of. They didn't do that, and instead ignored all of it. It's a huge missed opportunity because a lot of the stories the locals told of the legend of Blair Witch were more creepy than what was portrayed in this game.

The gameplay is about what you'd expect. Made by Bloober Team, if you've played Layers Of Fear 1/2, nothing will come as a big surprise. It's a typical walking sim with horror elements scattered throughout. It does have a really neat mechanic where you can manipulate time with your handycam. But in reality, the found footage element was not the only thing that should've been utiilzed from the movies. There are some tense moments to be sure, but many others leave you with a tired sense of non-accomplishment. As it's in a forest, you'll find many invisible walls and conveniently blocked off areas showhorned into the levels.

Graphics and sound are what make me recommend this game alone. You do feel like you're isolated in the forest with something sinister lurking in the shadows. I just wish they made better use of the whole Blair Witch legacy, because as it is, it would stand better as a different story altogether.

In the end, it feels like an original story that slapped the Blair Witch name onto it and then adjusted accordingly. But for horror fans it's certainly worth getting on sale and doing a full playthrough. For die hard Blair Witch fans, don't expect to get deeper into the lore at all...

3/5
