Having just played and still in the aura of unease from [Amnesia: The Dark Decent](https://thexypod.com/review-amnesia-dark-descent), I wanted more. It was recommended to continue the vibe with Amnesia: The Bunker by [The Arsenal](https://www.youtube.com/@The-Arsenal). The only thing I was told was that the story isn't connected, I don't need to play [Rebirth](https://thexypod.com/review-amnesia-rebirth) or Machine For Pigs before diving in, and that the game is awesome. I hadn't so much as seen a trailer, so I did go in as blind as possible. Imagine my surprise when I was immediately placed into a WW1 trench with chaotic gunfire and explosions going off in every direction. Did I install the right game? It was a complete 180 from The Dark Decent. And what's this!? I get a gun!? In Amnesia!? Yes... And after dispatching a few armed enemies to get the hang of shooting, I entered what would be my tomb for the coming hours. The Bunker.

## Overview
The Bunker has you in the place of Henri Clément who is a French WW1 soldier. In his efforts to find his friend, Augustin Lambert, you get knocked out. The injury has caused Henri amnesia (get it?) and he awakens to learn that he’s now trapped in the bunker and that it’s inhabited by a menacing beast that is stalking your every move from within the walls. Everyone who was inside has either fled or has been killed by the beast save for one.

The only soldier you run into is alive and tells you that the only way out is blocked by rubble from the previous party detonating TNT to seal the bunker. Your only option is to find more TNT and open the way yet again for your own escape. The only problem is that both the TNT itself and the detonator are in completely different areas of the bunker which means that you’ll be required to collect them both to blow up the obstruction. With that, your journey begins…

## Gameplay & Mechanics
Once you’ve entered the bunker, you find what will be your main lockable and secure “safe room” which contains an interactive lamp to save your progress. It’s also the place to fill up the gas tank of the main generator that will determine whether you’ll be playing in the dark or in well lit areas. Sanity has been removed as a mechanic in this title, but by playing in the dark the beast is more active making it that much harder considering you can’t see anything… so it’s best to keep the generator topped up from the various gas canisters found throughout the bunker. You also have a dynamo flashlight which needs to be charged up by noisily winding it. It’s a tradeoff you’ll be forced to make a handful of times throughout the game.

Stealth plays a major role in the game. It’s not as simple as just shrouding yourself in darkness… you need to pick your hiding spots and it would serve you better to take note of the hiding spots around you for each new location you visit. You really never know when the beast will come charging through a hole on a new hunt.

In The Bunker, you have a lot more at your disposal in terms of utilities. The previous titles had more of a “get an item” to progress, whereas in The Bunker there are guns, grenades, first aid, and a handful of other items that aid you along your way. But don’t get overzealous with these items, ammo and supplies are sparse, and you need to be smart about how they’re to be used. In the entire game there probably isn’t enough ammo to fill a modern magazine, but the gun is an effective tool to temporarily end an encounter with the beast and allow for your escape.

The beast isn’t the only thing you’ll need to contend with either. There are also mutated and aggressive rats that cluster in packs and block passageways. They can be either avoided by jumping over them with a distinct chance of being injured by them, lured away by raw meat that you’ll find strewed around the bunker, utilizing your firearms which is not recommended due to limited ammo and their respawn rate, or by dispatching them for a short time with a throwable.

Speaking of grenades, they're prevalent in the bunker, but not in the way you’re probably thinking. The previous inhabitants trapped the corridors and doors with both explosive and gas grenades as well as other devious methods of ensuring people or… things do not enter certain areas. These are typically marked with a small “x” that if you’re not looking for, you might miss it. If the generator has run out of gas, and you unknowingly run into a trap, good luck to you.

## Story & Narrative
The Bunker is not quite as plot rich as the other games in the franchise. That isn’t to say that it’s bad, or even shallow, but the emotional weight and backstory of some of the other games has taken a backseat to give you a more action-oriented title. There isn’t a lot of information given about Henri aside from knowing he’s a determined soldier and he has a strong loyalty to his friend.

You determine the events of the bunker from notes you find as you explore. From the second you realize that you are trapped, you slowly piece together that something has gone horribly wrong here. There are connections with TDD and RB; they're subtle and awesome. It won’t be mentioned here due to spoilers, but there is an overarching theme throughout, especially when it comes to the stalkers/beasts in the universe. There are a handful of twists and turns in the story but you’ll only get them if you read the notes carefully. The Amnesia series is not one that prides itself on offering exposition through cutscenes.

## Experience & Atmosphere

There’s a vacant airiness throughout the bunker that follows you the entire time. You’ll have creaks, cracks, drips, footsteps, and small sounds coming from every dark corner and it’ll keep you second guessing yourself. The Bunker really does a fantastic job at giving you a sense of unease. As you walk around with the generator off, it’s not in complete darkness, but just enough so that you don’t quite know what’s just beyond the shadows.

The first thing you’ll come to realize is that the AI for this game is extremely well done. Terrifyingly, when the beast is alerted, it not only knows where you are, but can sometimes accurately predict where you’re going to be. The dread gets multiplied as even when you’re not able to see it, you can still hear it traversing through the walls. It’s able to pop out from any of the holes in the wall that are scattered throughout the game. Each hole is connected from within the network of tunnels it’s built surrounding the entire bunker. Nowhere is safe… except the safe room… for most of the game anyway.

If you've played TDD and/or RB you probably noticed that both of those titles feature locations with wide open areas. This is distinctly not the case with the main gameplay of The Bunker. It all takes place underground and the tight quarters close in on you adding an element of claustrophobia to the mix making any escape that much more complicated. Adding to that, there are multiple dead ends around the bunker that lead to some terrifyingly fun encounters with the beast where you’ll be forced to interact. You always need to be aware of your surroundings and try to have an escape route or hiding place when possible.

## Audio & Visual

While the beast is traversing the tunnels throughout the bunker, you can hear it shuffling through as it gets closer. The positional audio is fantastic as you follow the path of the beast along trying to predict where it’ll pop out. Once it appears the stomps have even more of an impact. When you’re looking at the beast, there’s no sanity system, but your in-game heart starts beating out of your chest and panic starts to set in with heavy breathing with some intense music. All of this is expertly mixed into a beautiful symphony of horror.

The graphics are excellent even by today’s modern standards. It’s got a nice interface when you’re browsing notes and inventory. All the character models and prop pieces are period appropriate and modeled very well giving you a great sense of immersion. The rats are ominous with their beady, glowing eyes. The beast is grotesque and absolutely menacing. .

The music comes in every so often and while it’s subtle, it does a great job at either giving you tension, or relieving it depending where you are and what you’re doing. The safe room music lightens the mood, but being in the vicinity of the beast, the music will intensify along with your feelings of dread.

The voice acting is exceptional and its quality has become a staple in the Amnesia series. It’s a great thing that many of the notes (not all) you find have voice acted narration included. It adds a lot to the immersion and allows for the emotion of the letters and notes to shine through. Most walking sim games should be taking this same approach.

## Verdict

This is hands down a must-play in the world of horror games. Frictional Games has refined the model completely adding in elements of both action and survival horror. If you’re a big fan of Alien Isolation, then you should play this game immediately. Many horror games use the stalker format to add to the tension, and while they have a lot to offer, The Bunker definitely stands out above the rest.

Oh, and also Arsenal was 100% right. This is a standalone sequel and you don't have to play any of the other games in the Amnesia anthology to play this one. The Bunker has some loose ties to TDD and RB, but really you can pick it up and begin playing it even if you haven’t played the previous titles.

Frictional Games rarely misses. I haven’t played A Machine For Pigs yet, and I know full well it’s considered the weakest in the series, but I’m still looking forward to it. Rebirth faced some criticisms and it ended up being a stronger title in my opinion. They also have [ONTOS on the horizon](https://thexypod.com/news-66-horror-games-coming-in-2026) and having played these games I just can’t wait to see what’s in store. With The Bunker, they’ve created something truly special in the world of horror.

**Score: 6/6**
