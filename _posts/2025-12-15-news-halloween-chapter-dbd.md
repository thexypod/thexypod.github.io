This is an opinion piece an contains some speculation.

Behavior Interactive just [announced](https://deadbydaylight.com/news/halloween-leaving-dead-by-daylight/) that the Halloween DLC will be removed from the in-game purchase and store fronts. The Haddonfield map will also no longer be accessible. The achievements and perk names will be turned into generic named ones. Just a disclaimer, this is an opinion piece, so take anything I say with a grain of salt… fitting idiom considering the context. 

This is potentially due to the fact that Halloween: The Game is releasing in 2026. What a massive misstep. I think Texas Chainsaw Massacre was the only DLC that remained unaffected by the release of a new project of the same IP. Here's what I think is going to happen. Halloween the game will be released, it'll be hyped, and probably fun for a while. But ultimately, like so many asymmetrical horror IPs before, it'll drop off in popularity and will be abandoned. I'd like to believe otherwise, but we've seen it time and time again now. Dead By Daylight popularity isn't just based on its gameplay, it's because there are so many licensed characters to play, and the different maps from these licenses. It keeps the game fresh.

> ...games like this are too shallow of an experience to keep an entire player base interested for an extended period of time. 

Having your own standalone game **IS NOT** enough when it comes to holding the attention of your players. If you've ever played DbD, I want you to try to imagine a game where it's DbD, but you only play the one Haddonfield map (maybe with variations), you have limited characters, one killer, and that's the extent of it. That's precisely what these one-off games are trying to accomplish. Friday The 13th, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Evil Dead, Killer Klowns From Outer Space, Predator Hunting Grounds, (not to mention all the other original asymmetrical horror games have also been abandoned at this point) and it's astounding that they don't see the writing on the wall. The pattern shows that this game will also fail because games like this are too shallow of an experience to keep an entire player base interested for an extended period of time. The novelty will wear out over time and in its wake leave a giant gap in a beloved and established franchise. 

This move (if it's indeed due to the new game) also shows that there is an insecurity when it comes to the game itself. If they did feel confident enough, they would leave these licenses alone and let their own game speak for itself. Instead it seems like they're trying to funnel people into their own game by eliminating the “competition”. I don’t see why both games can’t coexist. 

> Unfortunately, it’s starting to feel like any of the licensed characters are on a proverbial chopping block. 

It's a shame too. Halloween was definitive in the success of DbD which gave a perspective seldom seen in video games. Seeing your favorite horror slasher in this setting was amazing and horror fans rejoiced knowing a horror icon could actually be controlled in a video game. At this point it's been a core part of DbD for over 9 years as the second chapter ever released. It wasn't the main draw for me, but absolutely piqued my interest. I have nearly 1900 hours in the game and that's not even a lot compared to some of the diehard fans. It's sad to know that the time I've spent in Haddonfield is coming to a close. Unfortunately, it's starting to feel like any of the licensed characters are on a proverbial chopping block. Held at the whim of the IP license holders. Stranger Things and Hellraiser have both suffered the same fate. Don't even get me started on Hellraiser. For some reason the owners of that franchise feel threatened about their single player story game. It's not even comparable…

If I'm wrong and making too many assumptions, that's on me. I obviously can't see the future and neither BHVR or the Halloween franchise have provided the exact reason why this is happening. But either way, this is a mistake. If it's the franchise trying to protect their upcoming game, it'll not do them any favors by immediately entering their product into the industry and souring the fans. If it's BHVR not continuing the licensing, also a misstep because the new game might bring in new fans looking for more. I get it, this can be a complex situation with many hands in the pot making this decision. Ultimately, this is a lose, lose situation for all involved and we'll have to wait and see how it plays out. Perhaps one day it'll return the same way Stranger Things has.
