The Steam Award winners have been announced and Silent Hill f has won in the category “Outstanding Visual Style”. It's well deserved! While I have my reservations on Silent Hill f in terms of it being a Silent Hill game [read full review here](https://thexypod.com/review-silent-hill-f), there's absolutely no denying that the game is gorgeous to look at and well designed from the bottom up.

The Outstanding Visual Style award is described on Steam as “Visual style doesn't aspire to real-world graphical fidelity (though a noble goal in itself)… it describes a distinctive look and feel that suffuses an entire game.” or in other words it won because it has a distinct artistic identity. Every setting, monster, effect, and prop has a unique style to it that stands out above your standard horror game.

Silent Hill f has won against

- My Little Puppy
- Doom: The Dark Ages
- Dream BBQ
- Final Fantasy VII

This is also a big year for the horror genre because the Steam awards also has quite a few nominees!

- VR Game of the Year Award
    - The Midnight Walk (winner)
    - Emissary Zero (nominee)
- Better With Friends Award
    - R.E.P.O (nominee)
- Outstanding Story-Rich Game Award
    - Last of Us Part 2
    - No I'm Not A Human
    - Dying Light: The Beast

It's really awesome to see so many horror titles getting some respect for 2025.

Here's hoping this encourages Konami to really push for more quality Silent Hill titles as Silent Hill f has received recognition in a couple of awards this year.
