Before getting into the game itself, I need to preface this review with my experience playing on an older PC [(check specs here)](https://thexypod.com/about). Whether due to poor optimization or excessive system demands, Unfollow struggled to run efficiently for me. Stuttering was constant and persistent, regardless of how much I adjusted the settings. By the third chapter, the performance issues became so severe that I was forced to mute the audio entirely while live streaming. I’ll do my best to remain objective here… If you’re running a modern machine, you may never encounter these problems. But if your setup is anything like mine, this is an issue serious enough that you may want to skip the game altogether. With that out of the way… let’s get into the review.

BrokenLore’s Unfollow first crossed my radar in my video [66 Horror Games Coming in 2026 and Beyond](https://youtu.be/AiGjTMYBJQs?si=HOiiCumCiLuUfMnP). It’s the fourth installment of an anthology, following three earlier entries that currently sit at “mostly positive” on Steam. With that track record behind it, I went in with a decent amount of optimism. Unfollow, however, ended up being… interesting in a way that left me more conflicted than impressed.

## Overview
you play as Anne, a young aspiring influencer haunted by both external and internal pressures. At school she’s relentlessly bullied about her weight, and at home she faces pressure from her mother to look a certain way. Anne’s life has been shaped by the influence of social media, both as a source of inspiration and as a catalyst for her anxieties.

The story begins in Anne’s own house, where she must explore her surroundings, confront echoes of her past, and uncover the painful choices that have shaped her identity. As she navigates this unsettling world, grotesque creatures stalk her every step, serving as symbolic manifestations of her trauma and fears.

The game uses its horror framework to delve into pressing issues such as cyberbullying, body dysmorphia, emotional isolation, and the psychological toll of being constantly “seen” online. Your journey isn’t just about survival, it’s about facing the darkest parts of Anne’s psyche and ultimately choosing how her story ends.

## Gameplay and Mechanics
The game begins abruptly, offering no establishing cutscene or real sense of context… you simply spawn inside the house and are expected to move forward. As a walking simulator, Unfollow doesn’t bring anything new to the genre, and in many ways feels too simplified. Encounters with “puzzles” are often reduced to on-screen prompts telling you exactly which item is required to progress, with that item usually sitting in a nearby room. There’s little in the way of challenge or discovery here. At times, these interactions feel arbitrary, making it difficult to understand how (or if) they meaningfully connect to the story being told.

At the bottom left of your screen you’ll notice Anne’s follower count adjusted in real time. You gain or lose followers based on your actions, but also bleed followers intermittently throughout the game. It may have been a benefit to have this as a game mechanic similar to a sanity meter so it added another dimension to the game. Either way, it doesn’t appear to have any affect on the game whatsoever.

You begin with an empty inventory and are almost immediately prompted to find a flashlight, as the basement is "too dark to enter without one". This framing suggests the flashlight will play an important role, but that expectation is quickly undercut. Moments after reaching the bottom of the stairs, you’re given access to working light switches, effectively rendering the flashlight unnecessary for the space you were just gated from.

This pattern repeats throughout the game, with every chapter requiring you to first hunt down flashlight batteries before you can properly proceed. It doesn’t meaningfully raise tension, introduce challenge, or reinforce the narrative… it simply becomes a routine task. The flashlight isn’t optional, but it also never feels justified, leaving you wondering why this friction exists at all instead of just giving the player the working tool from the start.

Each of the game’s seven chapters features a stalking sequence in which a figure from Anne’s life is twisted into a mutated form and sent to hunt you. In theory, these moments are meant to introduce tension through stealth, but in practice they fall flat due to unreliable mechanics. The game clearly expects careful movement and hiding, yet the stealth and detection systems feel inconsistent and often outright broken.

There are frequent moments where the chase music will abruptly fade in and out while crouched behind cover, watching the hunter stand at a distance, staring… menacingly, but seemingly unsure of what to do next. If the hunter does manage to corner you, death is all but guaranteed, as collision detection prevents you from slipping past them. There’s no visible health bar, but the game appears to operate on a three-strikes system, and these hunt sequences are one of the few times death is even possible making their inconsistency all the more frustrating.

Aside from the chases, there is one section in the game that has “combat” if you want to call it that. You’re suddenly armed with a cell phone flashlight and the combat has you shine your light at the enemy as they slowly saunter over to you. All you need to do is keep the light fixed on them to defeat them. Without getting too much into spoiler territory, there is a single boss fight that has the same mechanic and it is underwhelming as well.

It's surprising that the game wasn't running well on an older PC because the graphics aren't anything exceptional. Even with the “epic” setting, the game somehow feels dated.There’s also a mouse smoothing effect as you look around that makes looking around feel almost laggy. You’ll get used to it, but it would have been nice to have a setting to turn it off. There are also complaints about a head-bob visual giving motion sickness that is also unavailable to change. Keep that in mind if you’re susceptible to that as well.

## Story & Narrative
At its core, Unfollow tells a straightforward and largely surface-level story. Anne’s internal struggles, her relationship with social media, her body image, and her conflicts with family and classmates, form the foundation of each chapter. The game doesn’t ask the player to dig particularly deep for metaphor or subtext, and most narrative beats unfold exactly as expected. While a few chapters introduce player choice, typically framed around forgiveness or retaliation, these decisions primarily affect the ending and offer little incentive for repeat play unless you’re already invested in seeing every possible outcome.

The game also features several appearances by the YouTuber akidearest, with Anne explicitly citing Aki’s online success as inspiration for her own ambitions. While this connection is clearly intended to reinforce the game’s themes around online validation and influence, it ultimately feels more like a marketing decision than a meaningful narrative one. For players unfamiliar with akidearest, these moments carry little narrative weight, and even for those who recognize her, the cameos feel awkwardly inserted rather than organically integrated into the story. They do little to further Anne’s character or deepen the game’s thematic exploration.

By the time the story concludes, Anne’s character arc feels underdeveloped. The game gestures toward growth and resolution, but the payoff is understated to the point of feeling anticlimactic. Key emotional moments are handled in an on-the-nose manner, relying on overt symbolism rather than allowing the themes to emerge naturally through player experience.

There are glimpses of more interesting ideas beneath the surface. One recurring motif in particular stands out as unsettling and deliberately grotesque, hinting at deeper psychological symbolism tied to Anne’s struggles. Unfortunately, these moments are never fully explored, and they remain isolated flashes of creativity rather than a cohesive narrative thread.

In the end, Unfollow presents a story that touches on timely and relevant themes but rarely surprises or challenges the player. The conclusion reinforces ideas the game has already made clear, resulting in a narrative that feels predictable and emotionally muted rather than impactful.

## Experience & Atmosphere
Describing the atmosphere in Unfollow is difficult, largely because it never settles into a consistent identity. The game frequently shifts settings and presentation, often to the point where it feels like you’ve stepped into an entirely different experience from one chapter to the next. While variety can be a strength, here it works against the game, preventing any lasting sense of unease or sustained tension from taking hold.

Many of the environments lack a distinct personality. The spaces you explore often feel sparse and utilitarian, with props and environmental details doing little to reinforce mood, story, or character. Rather than feeling lived-in or intentionally designed, several areas come across as sterile, as though objects were placed simply to occupy space rather than tell a story.

This lack of atmosphere carries over into the game’s threats. The monsters and entities you encounter rarely feel intimidating, both in their presentation and in how they occupy the environment. Even when props are positioned in ways that seem meant to convey meaning or symbolism, the execution doesn’t fully land, leaving these moments feeling more decorative than unsettling.

Ambient audio also plays a surprisingly small role in shaping the experience. Outside of key musical moments, environmental sound design often fades into the background, doing little to heighten tension or guide the player’s emotional response. The result is an atmosphere that feels fragmented, moments of intent are present, but they’re rarely given the support needed to resonate.

Taken as a whole, Unfollow struggles to create a cohesive or memorable atmosphere. While individual ideas surface throughout the experience, they never fully coalesce into a space that feels oppressive, personal, or meaningfully unsettling, which ultimately weakens the game’s horror impact.

## Audio
The game’s audio balance is inconsistent. Music often overpowers both dialogue and jump-scare cues, which can diminish their intended impact. This issue is compounded by limited audio options, as the settings only provide a single master volume slider.

The voice acting is solid for an indie title, though not exceptional, and generally conveys the story adequately. The music, on the other hand, is very well composed, fitting the game’s horror themes and contributing strongly to the atmosphere. Its effectiveness is unfortunately undercut by inconsistent trigger points, which sometimes prevent key moments from landing as intended.

## Verdict
As it stands, if you’re still curious about the game, I’d recommend waiting for a price drop similar to what the previous anthology entries have seen. While Serafini Productions is clearly proud of Unfollow, and it’s easy to respect the effort, the game ultimately struggles to stand out in a crowded indie horror space where many developers are pushing boundaries with innovative mechanics and storytelling.

Considering the issues with pacing, mechanics, and inconsistent tension, there aren’t enough positive aspects to fully recommend it. That said, the anthology still has other entries, which have generally received positive reception. Unfollow may simply be a misstep, and if the studio addresses some of these criticisms, future installments could deliver the experience fans are hoping for.

**Score: 2/6**
