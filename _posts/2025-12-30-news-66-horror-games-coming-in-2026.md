Hello and welcome! I’m Xy, and this is a hand-picked look at upcoming horror games for 2026 and beyond. From big-budget AAA releases to indie horror passion projects these are the games that genuinely caught my attention. I’ll give you release windows and platforms when they’re available… but really, these are just the games I’m excited to dive into.

> There’s no ranking here, and no particular order… But at least that’ll keep you on your toes, right? That’s what we like as horror gamers, isn’t it? If you’re hunting for the next wave of titles that’ll keep you up at night… you’re in the right place.

## La Divina Commedia
I probably completely butchered that title, but I did my due diligence and looked up the pronunciation of it and tried my best. Developed and published by Jyamma Games, the synopsis is as follows; Breach the depths of hell and battle demonic forces as a warrior poet who has been lured into and trapped within the underworld. It's a Dark Fantasy ARPG inspired by the famous masterpiece opera of Dante Alighieri. The Game presents itself as a souls like game with the trailer showing a battle between the main character and a demon. Makes me remember Dante's Inferno which was released for the Playstation 3 back in 2010. Hell is always terrifying in movies and books, and while the trailer keeps things pretty vague, it still suggests there’s a ton of room for some really unsettling imagery. The sky’s the limit... or in this case, the underworld is—when it comes to the sites this game might show us. While no exact release date has been set, there's a good chance it will be out some time in 2026 on all platforms.

## Animal Use Protocol
Out of every title on this list, I can't think of one with a concept as original as Animal Use Protocol. This first chimp survival horror has you in the place of Penn, a hyper intelligent chimpanzee leading the desperate escape of lab animals from a nightmarish facility. This title is able to cut the tension as you have a rat companion named Trip who talks to you through a thought-to-speech generator. This leads to some unconventional, but funny dialog. (play run clip) This game looks like what Half Life would be if Gordon Freeman was the science experiment. This premise leaves the door wide open for some wild enemy and boss encounters. Definitely one to watch out for. Developed and published by “The Brotherhood” It’s scheduled for release in 2026 with no specific day or month listed, but it is set to launch on PC, with potential releases for Xbox, PlayStation, and Nintendo Switch.

## Halloween: The Game
Ugh. Another asymmetrical horror game... I know what we're all thinking. Do you think this will be the one that sticks? We haven't seen much luck with any asymmetrical horror games since Dead By Daylight. Looking at you Texas chainsaw massacre, Predator Hunting Grounds, evil dead, VHS, Last Year, Friday The 13th, Hide Or Die, Killer Klowns From Outer Space, Damned, puppet master… wait there's a puppet master asymmetrical horror game? Anyways, every time a game like this drops, you have to wonder what kind of new stuff it'll bring to the genre. And it's always a blast to see the film's settings have the ability to explore them. From what we know so far, there will be a single player campaign that's recommended for play before multi-player, so there's that to look forward to either way. Do I think the multi-player portion will end the popularity of Dead By Daylight? No. But it may be good for a year or two and it's definitely on my list of games to check out in the coming months. If I have to eat these words, believe me, I'd be happy about it. Developed and published by Illfonic, this game drops on September 8th, 2026. It will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC Steam and the Epic Games Store.

## Resident Evil: Requiem
Now, this list is not in any particular order, but if it were, I think most people would expect this title to be at the top of many lists. The Resident Evil series has been running on all cylinders with Capcom releasing both remakes and new titles. Requiem appears to take us back to Raccoon City where you play as FBI analyst Grace Ashcroft as she confronts her haunted past and uncovers the truth about the raccoon city incident. The trailer suggests that she's looking into a serial killer targeting survivors of the incident and gets tangled in the web herself. The trailer shown at the game awards revealed that Leon is making an appearance and zombies are returning as enemies in this installment. Resident Evil Requiem releases on pretty much all platforms February 27th, 2026 alongside the release of bio-hazard and village on the switch 2 and a Requiem switch 2 pro controller and... Requiem fortnight skins... Really? Sigh.

## Grave Stakes
Ever played the Jackbox Trivia Murder Party where if you lose you die? Grave Stakes feels like it’s riffing on that energy — but instead of tapping answers on your phone from the couch, you’re thrown into a first-person gauntlet of puzzles and mini-games for cash. The twist? A murderous entity is watching every round, and anyone who slips up gets their run cut short — sometimes literally — with a chainsaw or any number of other creative executions. This looks like the kind of game that would be terrifyingly fun with friends or absolute chaos for streamers playing with their community. Grave Stakes is developed and published by Wild West Games and is currently in playtesting, with its official release right around the corner on Steam.

## REANIMAL
Reanimal is from the original developers of Little Nightmares 1 and 2 which is important to point out because while the first 2 were well received, the third little nightmares game... not so much. Reanimal looks to have captured the same vibe. I haven't played little nightmares series yet... but I have played games like Darque, Limbo, and Inside. Let me tell you, while these games look cute, they don’t pull any punches when it comes to the elements of horror and it doesn't look like Reanimal is going to either. The art style for these games have their own originality and charm which I just adore. In this co-op horror-adventure game, a brother & sister go through hell to rescue their missing friends and escape the island that they used to call home. The game is developed by Tarsier Studios and published by THQ Nordic and Amplifier Studios. It’s set to be released on 13th February 2026, for Nintendo Switch 2, PlayStation 5, Windows, and Xbox Series.

## Fatal Frame 2: Crimson Butterfly
I bought the first Fatal Frame game for the PS2 the second I heard of its existence. I got frustrated with it to the point of stopping my playthrough because I wasn't aware you could refill your camera roll at the save points. Has anyone ever that? Just me? Anyways, I never got around to playing the second one and now we have this shiny new remake that is releasing in 2026. The story follows sisters Mio and Mayu Amakura as they are trapped in a ghost-filled village cursed by a failed ritual which they are being forced to re-enact. Gameplay follows Mio as she explores the village searching for Mayu, fighting hostile ghosts using the series' recurring Camera Obscura. With successful remakes from series like Silent Hill, Resident Evil, and Dead Space, I've got high hopes that this game will follow suit and be equally as well received. The release date for the Fatal Frame II: Crimson Butterfly Remake is March 12, 2026. The game will be released by Tecmo Games for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series Nintendo Switch 2, and PC (Steam). Pre-orders are currently available for most platforms

## OD
Look, I could wax poetic about all that could have been when it comes to p.t. and silent hills… I’m sure most of us can. And I'll be the first to admit that while I enjoyed death stranding, there obviously isn't a comparison. But OD on the other hand, it looks like we've got something promising in the world of Kojima horror. Also, Kojima Productions has seemed to gain favor with a large handful of Hollywood talent because he has no shortage of actors willing to join him in his creations. In OD, it looks like the main actress will be Sophia Lillis. We don't know too much about OD, release date included, but from what we've seen of it, it appears that it's going to be in the vein of P.T. or at the very least have some terrifying supernatural elements that are sure to be good. But like any Kojima game, the release date is as obscure as his plot lines. Kojima himself has recently come out to say OD is something completely different from a standard horror game, and they still don’t know if it will work out. Ok Kojima, keep your secrets.

## BrokenLore: series
If you’ve never heard of the BrokenLore series, don’t worry… I hadn’t either. But this psychological-horror anthology has been getting an increasing amount of attention, and for good reason. The developers, Serafini Productions, release these short-form, story-driven horror experiences that feel almost like playable short films. Two of their games are already out: LOW and DON’T WATCH. Both are well-received on Steam, sitting around the “mostly positive” range, and they typically run about two to three hours. Short enough to finish in a single sitting, but long enough to tell a complete story. And the series isn’t slowing down. There are three more entries on the way: UNFOLLOW, ASCEND, and DON’T LIE. Release dates vary, with some coming this year and others slated for next, but they all continue the anthology format: standalone psychological horror stories connected by tone rather than plot. If you’re into compact, atmospheric horror games that you can knock out in an evening, BrokenLore is definitely a series worth keeping an eye on in the coming months.

## Grave Seasons
So have you ever been playing Stardew Valley and thought, this could use a bunch of murder and violence? Me too! (show pierre) Enter Grave Seasons. On the surface, it's a cute farming sim with a wide variety of characters and a large town to explore. However, you're playing as an escaped convict... Oh and also, there is something or someone in the town that is killing its inhabitants. It'll be interesting to see how these two genres interact. Pixel art retro style with an isometric view, this game aims to please the horror enthusiast who enjoys a bit of farming Sim every now and again. Does that sound like you? Grave Seasons is developed by Perfect Garbage and published by Blumhouse Games and is scheduled for release in 2026 for PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and Nintendo Switch.

## Out Fishing
Speaking of odd pairings, next in the list is out fishing! Fish, sell, upgrade your gear, and build your camp in this first-person horror fishing game. Explore a haunted forest and uncover clues about a forgotten disappearance near the lake, but return before nightfall, as danger lurks beneath the water. Combining your typical fishing Sim with horror is an interesting take. I wonder if my dad would like this game. Out Fishing was slated for a late November release, but as of the time of article, they've missed their window so I'm assuming a 2026 release date if not sooner.

## Crisol: Theater of Idols
This is a gripping first person horror and action title set in the world of Hispania: a nightmarish re-imagining of Spain. The imagery for this game looks particularly disturbing as Daniel, the main character of the game, uses his own blood to utilize his weapons and ammo. That blood's gotta come from somewhere. This game delivers a highly cinematic horror experience, with haunting enemies and a deeply layered story. Puzzles play a big role, and the lore is rich—rooted in the dark folklore and historical traditions of Hispania. I love the design of some of these enemies and I'll definitely be on the lookout for this game in 2026 developed by Vermila Studios and published by Blumhouse Games.

## Silver Pines
Silver Pines is another game that looks truly unique from the rest. It's listed as a survival horror metroidvania, and has elements of a film noir. The synopsis is as follows: Private investigator Red Walker finds himself in Silver Pines, a place half-abandoned, half-forgotten, in the middle of nowhere on a job to track down Eddie Velvet. A musician who has vanished. As the case begins to reveal a dark past, Walker soon slips into a strange and nightmarish descent beyond his control. I love the art style of this and I'm interested to see how they utilize the metroidvania aspect of it. As an aside, anyone getting Disco Elysium vibes from this game as well? Silver Pines is developed by Wytch Elm and published by Team17 and is set for 2026. It will be available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series, and Nintendo Switch.

## Clive Barker's Hellraiser: Revival
When I first heard that there was a Hellraiser game coming out, my first thought was "great, another asymmetrical horror game that'll burn out and fade away like the rest." Can you tell I’m bitter? Anyways, I couldn't be more thrilled when I determined it to be a single player story driven game. It's funny how that seems to be pretty much unheard of these days with popular horror IPs. Anyways, Play the story of Aidan, who must use the power of a mysterious puzzle box - the Genesis Configuration - to help his girlfriend Sunny's escape from the otherworldly hellscape of the Labyrinth. Wield the powers of the box to survive your bargain with the infamous Pinhead and do battle with the horrific cult devoted to the Cenobites. From the looks of the trailer they aren't holding back from any of the “gorerotica” from the movies. But damn… I really hope this game isn't the reason Hellraiser was removed from Dead By Daylight. Clive Barker's Hellraiser: Revival is by Saber Interactive and is scheduled for release in 2026 on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series.

## Mortal Shell 2
Look, we never got an official PC port of bloodborne and I'm sad about that. But mortal shell 2 looks like it's going to bring some of that kind fire to the PC and I couldn't be happier. I've never played the first, but the consensus is that most people are looking forward to playing this one even more. The synopsis is as follows: Their Flesh Is Your Weapon. Mortal Shell II is a standalone sequel action-RPG with adrenaline-charged, high-stakes combat. Possess warrior Shells, dethrone false gods, and redeem a ravaged world. Standalone being the key word here. It doesn't seem like you even need to have played the first to enjoy this one. Mortal Shell 2 is developed by Cold Symmetry and is published by Coldstack. It’s scheduled to be released in 2026 for PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series.

## Dark Light Survivor
In a dying multiverse, the Phantom Train is your last hope. Traverse a post-apocalyptic, cyberpunk world of nightmarish creatures. Experience dynamic shifts between top-down and third-person views, deep customization, and epic battles across universes in this action roguelike survival game. I really like the vibe of this game. The trailer shows enemies as tall as buildings running alongside hordes of demons and they all want a piece of you. I also love the cyberpunk aesthetic mixed in with the horror and VHS vibes. It's definitely got my interest and I think it should have yours as well. There's already a demo on Steam that you can check out today and while their target window of Q4 of 2025 is closing quickly, it appears it won't be long before we're able to experience this game in its entirety. Developed and published by Mirari&Co. it's expected to release on PC, Playstation, and Xbox Series.

## The Occultist
The Occultist is described as a first-person narrative thriller and the trailer backs that up. It looks to be a very plot rich game as the trailer brings us through a multitude of settings. Abandoned buildings, churches, forests, hospitals, theme parks, this game has it all. You play as Alan Rebels, a paranormal investigator who travels to an abandoned British island after his father's disappearance. Explore GodStone island, face supernatural entities, and uncover long-buried occult rituals. However, Alan does not travel alone. He carries with him his mystical pendulum, an object of unknown origin that accompanied him on all his past paranormal investigations. As he explores the foggy streets and maddening buildings, apparently being the only things that remain on the mysterious island of GodStone, it becomes clear: This will be a case unlike any other. The Occultist is developed by DALOAR and Published by Daedalic Entertainment and is scheduled for release in 2026 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series.

## The Blood of Dawnwalker
The Blood of Dawnwalker is a vampire RPG which has you in the role of Coen, human by day and vampire by night. You’re fighting to save your family in a story shaped by your actions and the secrets you uncover. It’s set in 14th-century Europe. Bloody conflicts sweep the lands, and the Black Death comes for the survivors. It's a moment of weakness - and that's all they needed. Vampires seize their opportunity to walk out of the shadows and claim what they've been denied for centuries: freedom, and the power that comes with it. Other creatures of the night follow their lead. Legends turn into reality, and history as we know it will never be the same. It has some interesting features like a daylight meter and your health being directly tied to your blood hunger. We already have Vampire: The Masquerade as a rpg, so it'll be interesting to see what they do to make this title stand out. The release date has not been officially announced, but it is slated for release sometime in 2026. The game is developed by Rebel Wolves and Published by Bandai Namco Entertainment it’s set to be released on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series.

## Dreadout 3
Another Dreadout release by Digital Happiness. I played the original Dreadout game a while back and it was very memorable and had some awesome tense moments. I ended up skipping the second game, not because it looked bad or anything, it’s just the way things turned out, but this release has me thinking it may be time to give it a shot. DreadOut 3 is a third-person horror adventure inspired by an Asian - Indonesian urban legend. We rejoin Linda’s journey as a Keeper of the Dark into an interdimensional rabbit hole to find the source of unseen power threatening the balance of light and darkness. This spine-chilling sequel expands on the cult hit original, making DreadOut 3 another terrifying chapter in the world of the unseen. Deadout plays similarly to Fatal Frame in that your weapon is your camera. Though in this case the camera obscura is replaced with a modern day cell phone. I guess ghosts just don’t want their photo taken. No official release date has been set but it is slated for 2026 on PC with some mentions of Playstation or Xbox Series but so far, consoles also haven’t been confirmed.

## Shadowman Darque Legacy
Shadowman Darque Legacy is based off of the Shadowman comic books and while I’ve never read them myself, when I came across the trailer, it immediately caught my interest. For centuries, the Boniface family has carried a dark legacy - the mantle of the Shadowman, walker between worlds, sworn to preserve the veil between life and death. Now, novice Shadowman Jack Boniface is thrust into the path of a growing evil that threatens everything his predecessors fought for. Building upon the decades of Shadowman tales told within Valiant Comics, this new chapter is an original story developed in partnership with Valiant Entertainment. Shadowman: Darque Legacy has no confirmed release date and is currently delayed, potentially until the second quarter of 2026. The game is by Blowfish Studios and is planned for release on PlayStation 5 and is also listed on Steam.

## Silent Hill Townfall
Can you believe it's been 3 years since the release of the trailer of Silent Hill Townfall? Because it wasn't until I saw the leaked release date of March of 2026 that I noticed that the trailer is 3 years old. So far, we don't know a lot about Town fall. The trailer is cryptic and we have reasons to be wary about it. Silent Hill 2 Remake was great, Silent Hill f was received... well enough, but Silent Hill Ascension was a disaster. So we're what 2... or 1.5 out of 3 so far for this new generation of Silent Hill games. Hopefully townfall will be the tipping point and really launch us into the golden age of Silent Hill games. It’s being developed by a company called Screen burn whose founders previously worked on Alien: Isolation. I’m really hoping they bring some of that tension. Speaking of silent hill...

## Silent Hill Remake
It's been announced that Team Bloober has teamed up with Konami yet again to take on the remake of Silent Hill 1. With how well the Silent Hill 2 Remake was and how much the community enjoyed it, I think we can expect more of the same with this title. We haven’t had much in terms of screenshots or trailers, just the announcement so far, but I'm including it here because it's exciting nonetheless. Both Silent Hill games are published by Konami.

## The Twilight Project
You play as a tourist who gets lost in a forgotten village. As night falls, strange and terrifying creatures begin to appear, and reality starts to shift into something far darker. A third person survival horror game where you can experience an intense story with a unique theme of horror. You’ll need to survive the night, search for clues, and uncover the dark history behind this cursed place. Some secrets should stay buried... but they might be your only way out. The graphics on this trailer are stunning and the soundtrack gives me A24 horror movie vibes. It looks like what would happen if a Resident Evil game took place in the rainforest. I'm not sure if we're battling against zombies or a tribe with supernatural entities. Time will tell! The release date is still listed as “to be announced” with an initial window of Q4 of 2025. This window is closing quickly so here's hoping for a Q1 2026 release. The Twilight Project is developed and published by Teapot Studio only on Steam and Epic Games Store for now with no mention of console releases.

## Retrieval
Join Hana Loshe on a perilous journey into darkness, uncovering secrets and facing its deep drama story full of terrifying challenges on the distant planet Ryhalian. Dive into a deep narrative filled with unexpected twists, exploring themes of friendship, love, loyalty, and horror. This game is calling out to all sci-fi horror fans. After watching Event Horizon and playing games like Dead Space I think we can all agree that space as a setting in horror is absolutely terrifying and I'll welcome any addition to the genre with open arms. The trailer looks more gory than most on this list which is sure to add to the unease and tension. Retrieval is set to release sometime in 2026 on PC, Playstation, and Xbox Series and is by 333 Studios.

## EXP: War Trauma
You are completely helpless, your only weapon is your intelligence. Explore a mysterious and strange apartment, solve riddles, and most important of all, when the countdown starts, be quick. EXP War Trauma is a psychological Horror Experience about Traumas of a Soldier from WW2. This title gives me the same vibes as Silent Hill 4: the room that you're confined in is ever-evolving as you’re tormented by your past. The demo is already available on Steam and the release date is listed as coming soon. I'm really hoping to see some movement on this game in the coming year. The subject matter screams psychological horror, and it looks fantastic. It’s being developed and published by Cortez Productions.

Directive 8020 has been delayed and is now scheduled to be released in the first half of 2026.

## ILL
If you're into horror gaming, surely over the last year or so ILL has popped into your radar. From the looks of the tech demos and trailers it brings a very stylish horror to the scene... if it actually releases that is. There has been some speculation that the demos are not rendered in-game and that the actual game will be nothing like what we've seen in the trailers. There has been no release date and this game has been in development hell for sometime. Only time will tell if ILL will live up to the hype it's created, or be another flop from over promising and under delivering. I’m seriously rooting for this game and I hope it’s the former rather than the latter. It’s the first title released and published by Team Clout Inc..

## Blight: Survival
Medieval Zombies. Alright, pack it up. [cut to black as though to end this segment] What, you need more?? Because that was all I needed to be excited for this title. What an original concept. Blight: Survival is a PvE Action-Horror Game set in a brutal medieval world. Play solo or team-up with up to 3 friends as you face monsters and men in a tense battle for survival. How far are you willing to go? There is no confirmed release date for Blight: Survival at this time; the developers, Haenir Studio, have stated it is too early to tell, and a realistic release is likely no sooner than 2027. It’s published by Behaviour Interactive, the makers of Dead By Daylight. Initial development plans have changed, and the game is still in progress. It is expected to launch first on PC, followed by releases on PS5 and Xbox Series.

## Paranormal Activity: Threshold 
You may have your own opinion on the Paranormal Activity films, but the first one was one of the most successful found footage films ever made. So here’s hoping they bring some of the success to this game. It’s being built by Brian Clarke and DarkStone Digital… the same folks who gave us The Mortuary Assistant so you can sign-me-up. The trailer appears to have captured the vibe of the first movie and is sure to bring some truly tense moments. I’m curious to see how exactly this is turned into a game, hopefully it won’t be much longer until we find out. There is no exact release date but it’s slated for 2026 and while it’s listed on Steam already, I couldn’t find any info on console releases.

## End Of Abyss
This game has a thick, oozing atmosphere to the point where you almost have to catch your breath just watching the trailer. The top-down style is lending itself to some great looking claustrophobic moments.The enemies in the game make it that much more horrifying. They’re unrelenting and killing one merely splits it into two and so on. The pairing of an unknown organic threat and technological sci-fi gadgets is a classic mash-up. In the depths of a mysterious underground compound, a mission to investigate disturbances of unknown origin spirals into a harrowing descent through a broken and abandoned world. Play as the young combat technician, Cel, as she uncovers the truth behind the facility’s derelict areas and confronts the monstrous creatures that roam them. End Of Abyss is slated to come out in February of 2026 and as it's being developed by Epic Games, it'll likely stay an Epic Game Store exclusive.

## Drowned Lake 
When Bento, an amateur documentarian, vanishes, three strangers are drawn to the Drowned Lake to find him. As the lake's dark past comes to light, so do the secrets buried deep within them. Explore, survive, and investigate the dark waters in this fishing survival horror game. This game has all the Silent Hill vibes one could ask for. The soundtrack is very Akira Yamaoka in flavor, and it's an interesting take being both top down and first person. I love the glitchy visuals and decrepit backdrop. From my understanding it's in the same universe as their other game which is a found footage horror game Teleforum which is free to play right now. I didn't see a solid release date, but the developers, Monumental Collab, are currently playtesting so I'd expect a release in the next few months if not weeks. It’s being published by Critical Reflex.

## Liminal Point
Liminal Point is a top down survival horror and almost feels as if Claire Redfield entered Silent Hill. From what we can see in the trailer it looks like we're getting a puzzle focused game with grotesque monsters. You play as Lyra, who gets a message from Meera who I assume was the lead singer of their band. From what I gather tragedy struck the band and I'm guessing it's going to play into some themes of survivors' guilt while searching for answers. It looks like a fantastic addition to the survival horror genre and I love that it has the feel of a retro survival horror with updated camera angles and graphics. Liminal point is developed and published by HideWorks and has a TBA release date in 2026 coming out on PC, Playstation, and Xbox Series.

## Hellbound Inc.
Hellbound Inc. isn't a horror game per se, but I think that the setting fits with the theme of this list and now, at the middle of the list, is a good time for a little break from the dark tones and unsettling backdrops. Hellbound Inc. is an infernal platformer where you jump & carry packages to deliver against time, demons and HR. Play as an undead courier trapped in a fulfillment center recently purchased by Satan himself. You're the newest hire in Hell’s most infernal logistics startup. Your job? Deliver cursed packages across treacherous warehouse zones, dodge deadly traps, solve infernal puzzles, and make sure everything arrives on time. In Hell, missing a delivery deadline is eternal damnation… again. It's a cutesy platformer and I'm sure there won't be any real scares in this one, I love the art style and I'm making the article, so I'm including it. The release date for the game August 27, 2026 and it will be available on Steam only. It is developed and published by Templo and Rewilder. Ok, back to the dreary, dark, and horrifying titles.

## Becrowned
Becrowned is taking notes from both Silent Hill and Resident Evil, but not modern day versions of these titles, the “retro” ones… and they’ve completely nailed it. It does look like the fixed camera angles are not included in this one which is a huge plus from me. I loved those games, but that was one game mechanic I'm always happy to see away with. I love that the main character (Richard Torrence) is a nod to The Shining. Little details like that really go a long way in a horror game and will likely have people scouring the game for more Easter eggs. The write up on the game touts that it has leaned in heavily on multiple endings and it offers you choices which will greatly influence your storyline. This is going to add a lot in terms of replayability. There hasn't been an official set release date, but there's a demo you can play right now on Steam. It’s being developed by 13th Street Studio and will be published by Top Hat Studios, Inc.

## I Hate This Place
I absolutely love the style of this game and I think it brings some truly unique looks to the world of survival-horror. We’ve seen comic book stylized graphics in games before, but I believe this is the first time we’ve had a true horror comic book game. It makes sense too because it’s based on a comic book of the same name. I've never read it myself, but the subject matter is right up my alley! A quick check of the synopsis shows that it could be any number of X-Files-esque encounters. I really love how some of the sounds within the game have comic book style text. It really does a good job of feeling like a comic book comes to life. Scavenge and build to survive terrifying days and nights while using stealth and noise to fight enemies that stalk by sound. Developed by Rock Square Thunder and published by Feardemic, this title is scheduled for release on January 29th, 2026 on all major platforms.

## The Midnight Walkers
2026 will finally bring horror extraction shooters, so if you’re like me and had a minor interest in games like Arc Raiders and Escape From Tarkov, we’ll finally have a couple to call our own! In Midnight Walkers, Mr. Nobody has set up a deadly game show type of thing which is part survivor, part squid game, part extreme elimination challenge. He and his cronies take bets on who will die next and who will escape. It all takes place in the Liberty Grand Center where you enter solo or with trios and fight zombies and other “contestants” all while trying to obtain the best loot which can only be kept if you survive. Extraction gets trickier the longer you stay as each floor is systematically filled with a toxic gas that slowly kills you. This leads to some tense end game as whoever survives to the last floor meets and either teams up or kills each other for their loot. It's a great take on the extraction shooter and I love the post apocalyptic style. Looks like cosmetics will be a huge part of your drive to survive. It's slated for release in 2026 for steam only and it's developed and published by Oneway Ticket Studio.

## Welcome to Doll Town
In "Welcome to Doll Town," explore a cursed village where lifelike dolls roam. Uncover dark secrets, solve eerie puzzles, and survive the haunted dollhouses to escape a twisted nightmare. Once a bustling village known for exquisite handcrafted dolls, Doll Town now rots in silence and shadows. Abandoned factories, empty schools, and forgotten shrines are all that remain, haunted by memories of the students who perished here years ago.You play as Yumi, a student who takes a part-time job at the town’s only convenience store, unknowingly stepping into a nightmare that refuses to stay buried. As the line between reality and dream dissolves, Yumi must uncover the truth behind the deaths, the cursed dolls, and the macabre love story that destroyed the town. The style for this game is pretty unique with a low-poly look that’s almost black and white. It’s a good choice because it makes the use of color really stand out when it matters. It’s being developed and published by Bad Wish Games and has a release date of February 13th 2026 exclusively through Steam.

## No Vacation for an Executioner
No Vacation for an Executioner is touting PS2 style graphics and controls. It's set in the baroque era complete with waistcoats and harpsichords. It's a horror ARPG about a frustrated executioner in the late 17th century. He ran away from the gallows and aroused a riot of monsters that he is tasked with cleaning to find out the truth of this crazy world. The write up is very particular about the controls and the style of combat stating the control style is that of Resident Evil 4 and Silent Hill for the PS2. It's also got a focus on cosmetics so you can look your Sunday best while battling an onslaught of monsters using your sword and pistol. It's an indie game developed and published by JayO and is slated for release in 2026 on Steam only. There's a 45 minute demo you can try right now to see if it's something you're into.

## Beautiful Light
This is the second horror extraction shooter in the list, how cool is that? I’m seeing a ton of horror influence in this one from Alien to Death Stranding, and even Annihilation. Out of every game on this list the trailer is one of the most stunning. It looks like if X-Files had their own swat team that was sent out for each encounter throughout the world. The game features a quote “PvPvPvE” dynamic. The extra P is because you can also play as an anomaly and hunt the squads. From the trailer we can see tight quarters like office buildings and epic open world encounters from oceans to deserts and the beyond. You're entering each match with 6 squads of 3, all in search of unique artifacts and looting the area for materials used in crafting weapons and gadgets. If they’re able to pull off even a fraction of the kind of action we're seeing in the trailer, I’m certain this title will do well. It's being developed by Deep Worlds SA and is set to release in December of 2026 on PC first with the release on Playstation and XBOX depending on how well the game is received. It's a full year off, but if it's right, this will be well worth the wait.

## John Carpenter's Toxic Commando
At first I had to check that this wasn't an obscure John Carpenter movie adaptation that somehow slipped through the cracks for me. It's not by the way, it's a NEW IP from the mind of John Carpenter who's written the story and also provided the score for the game. The plot follows the aftermath of an experiment gone wrong trying to harness the power of the Earth’s core… only to unleash the Sludge God and all of their minions. To right the wrongs, a team of competent, highly trained commandos is needed to get the job, but they’re not in the budget, meaning the fate of the world lies in the hands of The Toxic Commandos! The trailer features a ton of weapons, snarky remarks from your teammates, and drivable vehicles. I'm not sure how right I'll be on this, but from what I can tell this game looks like Borderlands meets Evil Dead and let me tell you, I'm here for it. It's developed by Saber Interactive and published by Focus Entertainment, the game is set to be released in 2026 for PlayStation 5, Windows and Xbox Series.

## Valor Mortis
We've been seeing a lot of souls-like games popping up trying to capture the success of Dark Souls. Many of them look pretty similar in style, but Valor Mortis has taken it into a completely different direction. You play as a Napoleonic soldier killed in action and risen from the grave. You have supernatural powers to battle against the onslaught of horrifying monsters while getting to the bottom of a conspiracy that threatens the world as we know it. Explore beyond the dark corners of the world to discover the truth behind the plague and your unholy resurrection. The trailer really plays out like a scene from a horror movie I'd love to watch. It’s developed by One More Level and published by Lyrical Games. Another game where we don’t have a solid release date, but it is expected within the next year or so on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series.

## Shift At Midnight
Alright, bare with me here. I know the graphics aren't the best you've seen, but you gotta admit, the concept is pretty unique and sounds like a blast! We've been seeing a ton of these simulator games come out lately, from harvesting crops on tractors to owning and maintaining card game shops… but what if we add a bit of Papers, Please and body horror into the mix. That's Shift At Midnight. Stock shelves, clean up messes, and ring people out… but not before you check their ID to see if they are who they say they are. If something doesn't add up, it's up to you to tell whether or not you let them leave with their goods, or if they leave at all. To add to the madness this game has up to 3 person multiplayer so you can all survive the chaos together. This one is developed by Bun Muen and published by Kwalee coming out on Steam in Q2 of 2026

## SOS: Forgotten Planet
Have you been looking for an excuse to learn Morse code? The concept of this game is pretty unique in that interactions within an abandoned lab must take place using Morse code. It also uses your knowledge of Morse code as a difficulty enhancer from someone who’s never used Morse code to the hardened veteran. The game is entirely procedurally generated meaning each time you play it it’s a completely different experience. The developer “Risky Biscuit Games” has been streaming the development process of the game on Twitch and encourages feedback from the community. It features scavenging and crafting to help you as you navigate through an abandoned laboratory. I personally enjoy the cell shaded look of the game as it gives it a retro look. We don’t have an official release date for this one yet, but the Steam page says it’s slated for 2026.

## Nightmare House
This game might not necessarily be new to you. It was originally a Half-Life 2 mod that kinda blew up in popularity so the creators of the mod decided to make a part of it into a standalone game. You rely solely on your trusty axe while you explore the house as you search for an exit that may not even exist. Solve puzzles and defeat the evils that are hell bent on destroying you. This trailer shows some really awesome scenes they’ve made with the Unreal 5 engine. The poltergeist vibes have me thinking this one is definitely going to get under your skin. Even if you’ve played the original, they’ve revamped the lore and it sounds like they’ve come at this project from the ground up. If you’re like me and haven’t played it, then I think it’s time we see what all the commotion was about. Nightmare House is developed by We Create Stuff and published by Black Lantern Collective. The release date is listed as “Coming Soon” on Steam.

## Decadent
Decadent will be a first person action occult-focused horror game where you play as John Lorn, a royal explorer and veteran of the great war. He is headed to the arctic on a path he knows well, searching for clues regarding a lost Miskatonic University expedition. John has a parasite as a result of an occult experiment and it takes shape as an eye residing in the back of his hand. He is also suffering from disillusions. He can’t tell the difference between his nightmares and reality. The game draws inspiration from Lovecraftian horror, and what really stands out to me is that John appears equally proficient with both firearms and magic. That duality, paired with his fractured perception of reality, means the line between good and evil is constantly blurred throughout this story-driven experience. Developed by Incantation Games and published by Fulqrum Publishing we only have a release date listed as “coming soon” on PC, Playstation, and Xbox Series.

## Paranormal Tales
Every October there are 2 movie staples that are a must-watch for me. Hell House LLC, and the newest installment of the VHS anthology. So I’m excited to see more than one title on this list that features found-footage as the main concept of the game. I’d love to see a yearly installment of found footage games like VHS does, so maybe Paranormal Tales could take that role? Anyways, the game features hyper-realistic imagery as you experience and play through multiple tragic tales of those who went missing from the viewpoint of bodycams, phones, and VHS cameras. We don’t have a lot to go off of so far as the trailer appears to be a snippet of a man who’s looking for their dog “Teddy” and encounters a female presence who follows him while he takes refuge in an abandoned house. Do you have what it takes to play through the end of the footage? It’s developed and published by Digital Cybercherries and the release date is listed as “To Be Announced” on Steam.

## After Lights Out
Remember the movie “Lights Out” and how the main entity relies on the dark to traverse the area? Ok, now put yourself in that position where you wake up in a strange house and instead of just having the darkness determine where the monster will show up, it also determines the layout of your surroundings. The game is designed to prey on the fears you used to have (or maybe still do?) when you turn off the light in the basement and feel the need to outrun the potential evil chasing you. In this story, you’ll be piecing together clues and determine that you are a journalist pursuing leads on a missing persons case involving twin sisters who have disappeared from the house. You even have your own dedicated cork board to pool all the clues and try to make sense of this disappearance. Developed and published by POQI STUDIO, the release date is listed as “Coming Soon” on Steam.

## Frame Zero
Speaking of movies, have you ever watched the movie [REC] and thought, I want to experience this first hand… in a video game? Yeah, me too! And now we have Frame Zero. Following the death of renowned exorcist Father Gabriele Amorth, journalist Emma Sullivan and her cameraman Daniel Foster visit his apartment complex. Navigate the haunted building and uncover the truth before you suffer the same fate as Father Amorth. It’s being developed and published by Daloar, and this isn’t their only game on the list. The Occultist from earlier is also by them. I tried to look up the platforms or store fronts it’ll be released for and could only find that it’s being developed for PC. From what I’ve found it looks like we won’t have access to this game until 2027, but the trailer looks awesome so here’s hoping for a Q1 release.

## Dark Fracture
Dark Fracture takes advantage of a setting that quite frankly I'm amazed hasn't been used yet. A decomposition research facility or in other words a body farm. Pretty terrifying in its own right, but from the trailer it looks like we’ll also be traversing a whole other dimension or nightmare as well. Some of the scenes from the trailer are quite unsettling. The game features dual wielding, a sanity meter, physics based puzzles, and procedurally generated paranormal events which will lead to unique experiences with every new play through. The developers proudly mention their aesthetic was influenced by H.R. Giger, who defined the visual identity of the Alien movie universe. Developed by Twisted II Studio and published by Feardemic, this game has been in development for a while. Their official YouTube have been posting teasers and trailers for about 5 years now. There is a playable demo on Steam, but no concrete release date has been set as of yet.

## Agni: Village of Calamity
Agni Village Of Calamity has some truly cinematic elements going on. It also has a strong female protagonist which is great that we're seeing more of recently, especially in horror. This trailer gives me the hibbie-jibbies on a whole other level. Though it includes supernatural elements, the trailer’s real horror comes from how effectively it mirrors the unsettling reality of male entitlement and creepiness toward women. Something about the facial expressions has the main antagonist looking like a proper villain. Play as Agni, a determined investigator from a covert Indonesian police unit who defied orders and ventures into a remote village despite ominous warnings. What begins as an unauthorized investigation quickly plunges Agni into a horrifying reality that shatters her understanding of everything she knows. Developed and published by Separuh Interactive, the release date only states that we’ll be seeing this title in 2026.

## Ritual Tides
We don’t have a lot of info on Ritual Tides, but if you visit their website, and watch some of their YouTube videos, you’ll see this is a passion project of a lot of well-seasoned game devs who have worked for companies like Rockstar Games. What we do know is that the game will take place on a fictional British island teeming with Lovecraftian horrors where your only goal is to explore the island and uncover the secrets it holds. The devs are really focused on making each encounter unique and they’re paying particular attention to making the game mechanics and art style memorable. Looking through some of the concept art and the development process, you can see that they’re succeeding. They had an initial release window of Q3 of 2025, but seeing as that’s passed, we can only hope it’ll be available in the coming months. They’re targeting the release for PC, Playstation, and XBox Series. It’s being developed and published by Vertpaint Limited.

## We Harvest Shadows
We already have Grave Seasons on this list as your “Stardew Valley gone awry” farming horror sim. But what if we took that same concept, and made it first person and set it in on a beautiful farm that spans acres? That’s We Harvest Shadows. You play as Garret, a city man who needs an escape and decides that he’d be better off isolating himself on the farm to get away from it all. During the day you’re tasked with the day to day grind of running the farm and trying on the role of farmhand. However, once the sun goes down, everything changes and you’re faced with the horrors of the unknown out in the shadows of the vast farmland. This game appears to be an indie-dev passion project and the love for it shows in the trailers as well as the developer’s personal YouTube channel that he regularly updates with game news and the life of a dev. It’s developed and published by David Wehle and the release date is yet to be announced on Steam.

## Beneath the Frost
I'm getting some serious “The Thing” vibes from the trailer. The isolation, the snow and ice, the terrifying evil that lurks just outside your safe zone, or maybe it’s inside already? You’re trapped inside your downed spaceship. You utilize a robot companion to try and scavenge parts around the station so you can build an emergency beacon and try to signal for help and get off the planet. Help couldn’t come soon enough because some of the imagery in the trailer suggests that something truly sinister is happening. Severe weather reshapes the environment in real time, opening new areas and bringing hidden elements to the surface. This game is described as short, but just because it’s short, doesn’t mean it’s not going to pack a punch. Developed and published by Not a Sailor Studios it’s listed as “coming soon” on Steam.

Your objective is to escape confinement from a secret lab that’s swarming with grotesque and monstrous creatures. Wield a variety of psychic abilities to survive and overcome challenges. Unleash a forceful blast with the power of a bullet, use telekinesis to manipulate and hurl objects at high speed, cause enemies to implode under immense pressure, and create barriers to block and counter attacks. Face off against dreadful stalkers… twisted creations born from sinister experiments. These relentless creatures possess unique abilities, making them formidable foes who will stop at nothing to hunt you down. I’m getting some serious Mr. X vibes from the trailer, almost as if Resident Evil were specifically a sci-fi horror game. It’s being developed and published by Moon Catalyst Co. there is a demo to check out now, but so far we only have a release date listed as 2026 on Steam.

## Broken Veil
In Broken Veil you play as a young boy in a desperate search to find his mother. Set in a post-soviet provincial Russian town, you must make your way through the faceless horrors in your search. However, you’re not alone. There is a population of cats in the town that will help you if you use a laser pointer to give them direction. They can aid in solving puzzles and reaching places you’re not able to go yourself. Journey from dizzying heights to suffocating crawlspaces as you push toward your goal. Every location is packed with puzzles, hazards, and dangers shaped by their environment. Only quick thinking, agility, and raw nerve will see you through—if you can keep fear at bay. Developed and published by Sinistrum Games, there is a demo available on Steam that you can play right now, but the release date so far is only listed as “To Be Announced”.

## Project Spectrum
Project Spectrum is described as a free-to-play, asymmetric-PvPvE tactical thriller-shooter. Players manage a team of Agents deployed into the mysterious, reality-warped Ember Zones. Satisfying gunplay meets a mesmerizing, high-style world… but beware: unspeakable horrors lurk within. There isn’t a lot to go on for this game quite yet. The 3 minute trailer features some truly tense moments with dripping, ceiling crawling, phasing anomalies and some excellent sound design. There’s no official store pages as of yet, but the website is up and links to their socials are all there if you want to follow their progress. I also couldn’t see any info on what platforms this will be released for… but either way, it looks awesome and I’m excited to see more.

## Pinnacle Point
A dark, 90s-inspired psychological/cosmic horror set on a remote island. You play as Aron, returning years after an ill-fated expedition, haunted over abandoning his brother. Aron has unrelenting dreams about his brother who seems to be beckoning him back. Uncover the secrets of the island, confront the horrors awakened, and face those who seek to control its power. I’m really enjoying these throwbacks to the retro look in the games on this list. It shows just how much influence these games had on the developers. Low poly graphics certainly do not equate to low scare factor. Developed and published by Ready2Run the release date is currently listed as “To Be Announced” with a playable demo available on Steam.

Take in this gripping tale, explore the natural environment and haunting dreamscapes, and fight to survive in this horror experience.

## Quite a Ride
My initial thought was Pacific Drive, but on a bike. But when you see this trailer, you'll see that it's packed full with all kinds of horror inspired elements. I was getting vibes from Death Stranding, Alien, and Silent Hill. In Quite A Ride you'll be exploring an ever-changing abandoned region that looks and feels like Chernobyl. You traverse the landscape on your bike while you're inundated with all kinds of anomalies. They float, stomp, and manifest themselves at you while you try to piece together the truth of this world. You have a mysterious phone sending cryptic clues to help you on your way. You'll need to keep that cardio going as if you stop peddling your bike, you become an easier target. Developed by Goodwin Games and published by Silver Lining Interactive, the release date is listed as “To Be Announced” on Steam.

## I Am Ripper
This game seems like it's going to be almost like L.A. Noire, but with strong horror vibes and set in a small British town in the year 1987. The world has just suffered an economic crisis. A forensically confirmed serial killer has been racking up his kill count and you’re the one tasked with bringing them to justice. Throughout the game, you will be faced with critical decisions which will change the outcome of your investigation. You must confront a series of gut-wrenching challenges placing the fates of others in your hands. Find the forensics, reveal the secrets and pursue the person responsible. The game features branching narrative and each decision you make will ripple through your timeline and change the story in unique ways.  The game focuses on high interactivity and will force you to pursue disturbing forensic analysis. Judging from some of the imagery from the trailer, this game is not for the faint of heart. Developed and published by White Paper Games it has a release date that is yet to be announced. It’ll be available on PC on Steam, Epic Game Store and GOG.

## Contaminant
In Contaminant, you step into the tragic shoes of Maria, the beloved granddaughter of the owner of a mysterious factory. You uncover the family secrets while facing up against brutal combat, twisted puzzles, and surreal realms of abominations. It’s a third-person survival horror set in a post-Soviet reality. Curiosity is your only guide, just don’t expect doors you walk through to lead you back to safety. Not only do I love the surrealist approach to the level and character design, I’m also really digging the VHS aesthetic. I also tried to look up the soundtrack in the trailer, but came up empty handed. It’s got a late 80s goth feel to it, so if you know who it is, please let me know. Developed and published by M3at Bicycle, the release date is listed as 2025 in the trailer, and “coming soon” on Steam… so your guess is as good as mine. I’m just really hoping we some some action on this game in the coming months.

## Haunted Bloodlines
What if we took the mansion from the first Resident Evil game, but instead of zombies, it was the mansion itself stalking your every move. Because it's alive. And also there's nothing to defend yourself with except distance from whatever is hunting you. That's Haunted Bloodlines. Featuring a sanity system, realm crossing abilities, and time altering puzzles, this game is definitely bringing a lot to the table. Discover the mansion's tragic family secrets, and uncover the horror that resides within the walls. Developed by Horrified Triangles and published by Iphigames and Serafini Productions, the creators of the BrokenLore series. The release date is listed as “coming soon” on Steam and I found they’re also targeting a Playstation release as well.

## Eyes Never Wake
So what if you need a little more immersion in your horror game? Maybe you don’t have readily available access to VR. Well, I got some good news for you, Eyes Never Wake takes advantage of your webcam and uses it as a controller putting you directly into the game. If the monster sees your face in the frame, it’s not going to end well, so you better duck out of view… physically! As if that wasn’t enough, you’d better keep quiet as well because not only is the monster looking for your face through the webcam, it’s also listening for the smallest squeak coming from you through your microphone. Lore-wise it seems as though you’re playing a game you’re not supposed to leaving you in a backroom type of place by clipping out of bounds. This one is coming from a solo dev Allan Hedlund and the release date is currently listed as “Coming Soon” on Steam.

## ONTOS
The next release from Frictional Games, the developers of the beloved Amnesia franchise and the sci-fi horror game SOMA. Frictional Games have a solid command of the horror genre, and it looks like they’re poised to unleash yet another sci-fi horror game onto the world. Set on the repurposed moon hotel Samsara, you must uncover cryptic experiments, face unsettling encounters, and piece together a mind-bending narrative. The deeper you go, the more the truth unravels as you confront the ultimate question: What is reality? As you delve deeper, guided by fragments of your father’s cryptic legacy, you must confront disturbing revelations about the nature of existence, and your place in it. ONTOS presents a gauntlet of chilling experiments and disturbing encounters that push the boundaries of both science and morality. If you’ve played SOMA and the Amnesia series, you know Frictional Games is about to drop another hard-hitting, narrative driven, classic. It’s set to release in 2026 on PC, Playstation, and XBox Series.

## The Day I Will Die
Trapped in a misty valley of endless time loops, confront echoes of your childhood and creatures from old tales and legends. Explore forgotten paths stirring subconscious fears, face nightmarish foes, and uncover a story of fading dreams and shadows of adulthood. In the hidden corners of the valley, you recognize places from your childhood… forest trails, stone bridges. They awaken memories: old dreams, past fears, unfulfilled ambitions. The Day I Will Die is a first-person action thriller with a dynamic, varied combat system. Using a diverse arsenal of weapons, you will confront enemies shaped by childhood fears and dark legends of the past. As you traverse the valley, step by step, you draw closer to understanding what truly happened - and what still waits behind the veil of mist. In the end, you will also face what we have created within ourselves as adults. Developed and published by Lost Lighthouse Games, The Day I Will Die is set to release some time in 2026 on Steam.

## Cthulhu: The Cosmic Abyss
We’re finishing off this list with a trailer that is just wild… and not for those who have thalassophobia, or megalophobia. Obviously it features staples of Lovecraftian Horror, but also adds in elements of Cyberpunk. The year is 2053. You play as Noah, an agent of Ancile[un-KEE-lay] tasked with investigating a missing mining crew from the depths of the Pacific Ocean. You have an AI companion named “Key” to aid you on your journey, and you’re going to need all the help you can get. The miners have ended up in R’lyeh, a massive underwater city that keeps Cthulhu imprisoned. As Noah enters this realm he is under constant psychic pressure from Cthulhu driving him ever closer to madness. Developed by Big Bad Wolf and published by Nacon and will be released on PC, Playstation, and XBox Series some time in 2026.

Well, there you go. 66 upcoming horror titles for you to sink your teeth into in the coming months. There were a couple more that I could've added, but I think this is a nice, completely not evil number to stop at. I've added these honorable mentions and anything that slipped past me after I made the video to this blog post. If you've made it this far, that tells me you’re an absolutely hardcore horror game fan. Thank you so much for watching! And hey, I stream 100% horror games on YouTube and Twitch, so if you want to turn any part of this video into a conversation, consider subscribing/following so you can catch me live for a chat. I’ll definitely be diving into a few of these games on stream. I’m always happy to talk about anything horror: games, movies, books, comics, music. I love hearing people’s perspectives; what you liked, what you didn’t, and why.

And before you go, let me know in the comments on the YouTube video which game you’re most excited about, or if I missed something you think I should check out, or if I brought one to your attention that you’ve never seen before. If you don’t mind hitting the like button on the youtube video, it will really help out the channel a ton… I think… I'm pretty new to making videos like this so I hope I did it justice enough for that. All music provided by Karl Casey and White Bat Audio. He provides royalty free music to any creator and all he asks for in return is attribution. So give him a listen! His entire catalog is just awesome! Anyways, thanks again for hanging out, and I hope to see you in the next one.

## Honorable Mentions

These are the games that I wish I could add to the list, but there just wasn't enough time to get it all together. Still not in any particular order, just added as I found them. These games really vary in style and gameplay, and they're all just as deserving to be on this list as any of the others listed.
