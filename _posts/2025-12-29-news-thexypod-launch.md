Well, this has been a long time coming, and now we're finally here. I'm excited to launch the all new 100% Horror game site TheXyPod.com. Here, I'll be featuring all the reviews that stem from my playthrough of the game on stream. I've wanted to do this site since I started live-streaming back in 2018. Only after I officially became a web dev myself did I feel confident enough to actually do it.

### Who I Am
I'm Xy! I have been streaming horror games on [Twitch](https://twitch.com/TheXyPod) since 2018 and recently began multi-streaming to [YouTube](https://youtube.com/@TheXyPod?sub_confirmation=1) as well. I grew up on horror, from movies to games, books, and comics so I'm continuing that here. Horror isn't all I consume, but it takes up a lot of it. I'm also into sci-fi and city building games too! You can read more about me [here](https://thexypod.com/about/)

### What's With The Name?

Long story short, I was using the world of Warcraft name generator in the character creation (undead warlock btw) and it came up with "Cybel". I liked it and tried to use it, but it was taken. I replace the "C" with an "X" and it clicked. Every character I made from then on started with "Xy" because the people in my guild shortened my name to that. Just "Xy" is pretty hard to get on any social media, so when I initially wanted to form an online presence, I thought of doing a pod cast. That didn't work out, but the name stuck. Plus I guess you could consider the live streams as podcasts... bit of a stretch, I know, but I'm not looking to do a rebrand any time soon.

## The Site Basics
It's pretty straightforward, but let me break it down. The home page will feature all the featured posts as well as some of the latest posts. The featured posts are posts that I think are noteworthy and should have a priority in reading. They'll likely stay featured for a while so that new visitors of the site can see them as well. Navigation so far is simple:

- Home - the front page of the site
- Reviews - contains all the reviews posts
- News - contains all the news posts
- About - all about me! :)
- Contact - has a simple contact form that'll email me
- Fine Print - any disclaimers I have regarding the site (only in the footer nav)

### Reviews
The reviews are based on the games I play on stream. Typically, since there's a livestream of the game, I'll also include a link to the stream itself at the top of the post so you can watch my opinion form as it happened. Some of my reviews are going to be from games I played a long time ago and I'll rewatch the stream to remember my take on it.

The reviews will contain minimal spoilers, both in narrative and in jumpscares. If a spoiler must occur, it'll be blacked out so it's not readable unless it's clicked or tapped on. I tried to make this accessible too, so if you're on a screen reader, please let me know if you run into any issues with that. Here's a test spoiler <span class="spoiler">This is a spoiler, it will only be visible when clicked or tapped on.</span> If I need to refer to a different game and its own spoilers, I will also black that out as well.

#### Ratings
Ratings are out of 6 because I think it's cute... that's all. I have a recurring theme of 6 on all the content I make. For instance, you can use 66 bits on Twitch to trigger a jumpscare alert. My video on the upcoming horror games in 202**6** featured **66** games. I'll probably keep going with this. I'm not into the number of the beast or anything, I think it just goes well with the horror theme.

### News
The news portion is exactly what you'd expect. I do my best in trying to find the latest news, and anything I deem newsworthy will be in this section. If I have a strong opinion on the matter, I will include my take and tag it with "opinion" and place a disclaimer at the top of the post. If you've got a new horror game you're working on, or a hot tip that you want to share, I'd be happy to look into it! Just [contact me](https://thexypod.com/contact/) on the form or through [Discord](https://discord.gg/AwVkDQRhjx).

### Tags
Each post will have a read-time so you know how long it is at a glance as well as display tags that pertain to the post as well. These tags are links that lead to a list that features posts that contain only those tags so you can view posts that are similar in content. Since the site is 100% horror, you can assume that the tags should read TAG + horror. Obviously this doesn't work for every tag, but just as an example if you see "psychological", assume "psychological horror".

## Comments, Questions, Concerns?
If you have any comments, questions, or concerns on any of the content on this site, feel free to [contact me](https://thexypod.com/contact/) using the form on the contact page. You can also [join the Discord community](https://discord.gg/AwVkDQRhjx) and discuss them there. Comments are not enabled on the posts yet because it costs money and I don't have a lot of that. What you can do is go to the [subreddit](https://reddit.com/r/TheXyPod) and discus the post there. 

## End Remarks
I'm glad you're here. It really means a lot to me. I've been putting a ton of work into this just in my free time. It's a hobby, but also a passion project. Bare with me while I get all this together. The site is a little barren as I've really just started. Over time this site will hopefully contain quite a lot of content and hopefully become your trusted source for horror games. If you want to turn any part of the content on this page into a discussion, join me on Twitch or YouTube for a chat! I'd love to see you there. Until then, please enjoy the site!
