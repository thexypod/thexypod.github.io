I remember seeing the trailer for Greyhill Incident when it dropped and was instantly drawn to it because the subject matter hadn't really been seen in a horror game before. A horror game featuring aliens! How could you go wrong? Well, the core structure is there, and it offers some good… but with the good comes some… not so good. Let’s dive in. 

## Overview
You play as Ryan, a “standard resident” of Greyhill. The game starts with you chatting on the radio with a few of the other residents. All of them are conspiracy theorists and it comes through that there are reports of something strange happening in Greyhill and you’re tasked with trying to find the cause. You then meet your son, Henry, who’s been acting strange ever since his trip to the forest earlier that day. He’s less than forthcoming about it, but during your conversation, you hear something coming from his bedroom and go to investigate… with that the game begins. 

## Gameplay & Mechanics
When you first load up the game you’ll be prompted with the standard “adjust slider so the logo is barely visible” direction. Leave this much higher than you think you should, otherwise you’ll end up playing the game in mostly complete darkness using a Fisher Price flashlight that needs constant winding every minute or so. Even still, you may be better off just boosting the gamma/brightness right up so you can actually see the game. The flashlight is essentially useless throughout the game, and it only alerts the Greys. 

One of the game’s more glaring issues becomes apparent once you start interacting with items: the sense of scale is noticeably off. Several objects, like a guitar and baseball bat for instance, feel as though they’re comically oversized. Even smaller items, such as rolls of tinfoil, appear far larger than they should. The models themselves are well-made, but their proportions are misjudged. As a result, otherwise solid assets end up feeling visually wrong, giving the game a consistently wonky, poorly considered look.

The combat is lacking. Greys lock on and pursue you once alerted, whether that’s from proximity, noise, or forgetting to put your flashlight away. If one catches you, you’re forced into a quick-time event struggle that requires mashing “E” to fill a rapidly draining bar. Success briefly stuns the enemy, failure results in an instant game over. Being grabbed by two greys at once also means immediate death. While they can be difficult to evade at first, once you learn their patterns they stop feeling threatening and instead become little more than a persistent nuisance.

The baseball bat is difficult to use and there are plenty of times where you’ll be asking yourself why the swing didn’t connect. Once you get the swing of things 😏, it’s fairly repetitive. Hit the grey 3 times to knock them out, run away, hide. Rinse, repeat. The gunplay is fine enough for what it is, but the ammo is severely limited, so you won’t be experiencing much of it. It would almost be more beneficial if the game has more greys and more ammunition than keeping them both as limited as they are. 

## Story & Narrative
For story and narrative you’re not going to have to dig too deep. Greyhill Incident is pretty shallow when it comes to the storyline. You won’t need to go searching for metaphors in this game. It takes place over the course of a night and Ryan goes from one place to the next while receiving arbitrary tasks over the radio while trying to complete his main task (spoiler territory).

Ultimately, the whole storyline falls flat on its face as the game ends. There is no resolution, no character arc, just an event followed by the end title screen and credits. The game tries to give you closure by giving you exposition through dialogue, but it still doesn’t answer any questions and actually ends up with even more. Perhaps the idea was to leave the ending open for a sequel, but instead feels as though the story simply didn’t know how to resolve itself, so it just ends arbitrarily.

> …[the game] borrows vibes from movies like Signs, Independence Day, and Fire In The Sky and it does it well.

## Experience & Atmosphere
The atmosphere is where Greyhill Incident does get something right. It borrows vibes from movies like Signs, Independence Day, and Fire In The Sky and it does it well. Walking around the neighborhood you feel the unease and know there are greys lurking in the distance. There are a few spots throughout the game that offer great scares. Having greys lock on and start chasing you produces this unsettling music that initially may give you goosebumps at first, but end up becoming background noise. 

The setting of the game takes place in a rural area of the USA. You navigate around by walking through different farms and properties. The night is dark and foggy making it difficult to make out what’s out in the void. There are typically lights in the form of conveniently placed lanterns meant to guide you toward your next objective. Unfortunately, they’re easy to dismiss as environmental dressing, which can leave you wandering aimlessly.

## Audio
Where the atmosphere is the good part of Greyhill Incident, the audio is the bad part that counters it, and it is BAD. As you’re listening to conversations taking place over the radio, mind your ears because there are some seriously ear-piercing sounds that come through. It’s not properly mixed at all and it will take you out of the game quite a bit. Aside from that you’ll also find that some interactions don’t blend with the other audio at all. The audio design regularly overshoots its mark. Bat impacts are mixed so loudly they feel inches from your ear, and the Grays’ constant scanning sound channels a bad 1950s sci-fi aesthetic that’s more annoying than unsettling.

The voice acting tends to be a little melodramatic at times, and some of the lines that are delivered are… not great. That would be forgivable in most indie games, but in Greyhill Incident, it’s the timing of the conversations that really take this whole game down a couple of points. Conversations regularly trigger out of sync, with characters talking over one another before lines have finished playing. The result is broken pacing and scenes that collapse into a jumbled wall of overlapping dialogue. If this were an occasional hiccup it might be excusable, but it happens so often that it actively undermines the experience and makes the game feel unfinished.

A particularly jarring bug is that some audio ignores its source. In a couple of cutscenes, you can wander away while still controlling your character, yet the sound plays at full volume as though you never moved, breaking immersion entirely.

## Verdict
I really want to score this game higher based on just the originality and premise. But most of the downsides will greatly outweigh the upsides. Don’t get me wrong, I did enjoy a few things in the game, but it’s a hard sell when you’re constantly taken out of the experience with odd bugs, poor design, and harsh audio. The ending solidifies my complete lack of interest in replaying it. 

If they took the time to actually polish this game up a bit, it’d be a little easier to recommend it. Seeing as it’s been out for nearly 3 years at the time of this review, I won’t be holding my breath as they only update came in the form of DLC which literally only adds an additional "found footage" filter in the game menu. With all that said, if you can look past the issues, there is some good in the game that could serve the bored gamer for a couple of hours. I think it would serve the devs well to drop the price even more, making the game a bit of a novelty instead of a gaming experience. 

**Score: 1.5/6**
