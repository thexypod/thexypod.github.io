Every so often I’ll have a peek at keymailer to see if there are any horror titles of interest. That’s where I found The Blessing of Airon. It stood out among the rest as the concept sounded interesting, and the visuals looked really good. I submitted a request and after a while got approved. So full disclaimer, this game was received for free.

## Overview

The Blessing of Airon is the debut title from BakerTheGameMaker and puts you in the place of a priest centuries in the future. It begins as a nightmare. A scourge has infected certain electronic devices with something dubbed the "Neural Demonic Phenomenae". It’s up to you to stop a recent surge of activity caused by some missing boys from the congregation. You set out to investigate the Magdeburg Research Facility in search of the boys and to finally put an end to the haunting presence infecting the area. The facility was a hub that was used in the research and destruction of said devices and it’s hinted that a priest in your church is already on a quest to stop it himself.

## Gameplay & Mechanics

The gameplay is about as standard as a walking sim gets: WASD to move, run and jump, and left-click to interact. These simple mechanics carry you through exploration and a couple of light puzzles. Early on, you pick up a flashlight (or several, for some reason) which becomes your primary light source in darker sections. Thankfully, the game never gets so dark that you miss the environmental details, which clearly received a great deal of attention during development, but it is dark enough to give a good sense of unease.

One aspect that may persuade/dissuade you from the game is the reading. There is SO much reading. Almost every item has a full description attached to it in the first half of the game. While this offers quite a lot in terms of world building, it could have been summarized in a single document leaving fewer options more as Easter eggs than the main exposition. That said, it is all well written and offers some truly comedic moments taking stabs at internet culture in the “before times”.

You may find that there are a handful of bugs that can be game-breaking. Menus will sometimes remain on screen after exit and block game interaction requiring a complete restart. Action prompts remain and can even lead to duplication of items. Pair all this with the lack of any save system and it’ll have you backtracking quite a ways should you run into them yourself.

## Story & Narrative

The narrative is the core strength of TBoA. The overarching theme is nailed into your head repeatedly… electronic devices have become evil and all consuming. It carves out an effective horror niche with technology and religion that pairs into horror quite nicely. The store page describes the experience as “A relaxed pace that favors those who take their time to closely inspect the finer details of their surroundings.” and this is accurate. As stated above, there is a lot to read, but the more you read, the more you’re likely to take away from the experience.

Overall, it would’ve benefitted from a bit more backstory with our protagonist. There are small hints about who he is, but not enough to really define him or his place in this electronics-free world. Meanwhile, other characters get more personality through messages and notes, so they sometimes feel more developed than the person you’re playing.

The ending is pretty abrupt, and though it resolves the game’s main objective, it may leave you feeling a little disappointed. Not just in how it’s presented, but also in that once the end sequence is complete, the game just automatically shuts down without any end credits, or bringing you back to the main menu. It can feel a bit jarring.

## Experience & Atmosphere

As you navigate to the various locations, you get a liminal feel as all of it is vacant which definitely adds to the atmosphere. The unkempt, snow filled pathways give you a sense of the struggle the characters have been through. Dilapidated areas show just how hectic and unruly the world has become without the aid of these devices. The Neural Demonic Phenomenae that brought them here has left them in a seeming frenzy as they document everything to try and make sense of it all.

However, the game has very few tense moments. Though marketed as a horror, there isn’t much in terms of scares. There are moments that are shown on screens scattered throughout the game of archived livestreams from when the Neural Demonic Phenomenae occurred. This is a major contributor to the tension and it’ll leave you wishing it had more. But, aside from a few visual anomalies, there isn’t much else to add tension.

## Audio & Visual

Visually, TBoA can be striking at times. The level and prop design is impressive and helps with the immersion. Some of the visual effects are unsettling and add to the horror. However, you may notice a few artifacts in the frames along the way. Standing too close to a door allows you to see through it for example. But do keep in mind as you play that the game has themes around electronics and uses glitches as a visual effect. Some glitches can come across as bugs, so it's important to be aware of this as you play.

The audio is another strong element of the game. The audio design is great for horror and the little voice acting that is in the game is well recorded and acted. The music fits the setting and some of the more atmospheric parts add a good amount of tension.There are a few moments that’ll leave you wondering if it was loud to prompt a scare, or if it was just improperly mixed. Speaking of mixing, the game could also use captions as some of the areas with dialogue often get drowned out by ambient sounds as well.

## Verdict

I did enjoy my time with TBoA. The storyline was interesting and I liked the pairing of technology and religion. The bugs unfortunately bring this game down. If you’re intent on experiencing it for yourself, wait for a sale. I think a $10+ price tag for about an hour of buggy gameplay seems pretty steep, especially when the majority of that play time is made up of reading. If the game was tightened up a bit, I could see it being a stronger title justifying the cost. As it stands, TBoA is an interesting experience that feels more like a story-rich demo than a fully fleshed-out game.

**Score 3/6**
