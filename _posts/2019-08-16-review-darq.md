DARQ is a super atmospheric puzzle platformer horror!

Very reminiscent of Inside or Limbo! The mechanics are simple enough to understand and are introduced in a way that helps navigate the game throughout. The graphics are what you see in the trailer and screenshots and doesn't deviate much. The sound design is on point and with some decent headphones and volume, you can expect some real creepy moments and excellent well timed jumpscares! It was exciting to encounter each monster and try to figure out what to do. I was never frustrated at the puzzles and would say that the flow of the game was on point.

My only issue (and it is a small issue) is that the game is a touch on the short side and doesn't offer much in terms of story. Perhaps the story is open to your own interpretation? There are 7 chapters total and I finished the game twice and got all the collectables in 4(ish) hours. I was streaming at the time so I had many sets of eyes helping me along. That being said I had absolutely no problem starting from the beginning and going for a second run. Whether or not it's worth it for you really depends your budget. I could see myself picking this back up in a year to go through it again for the experience and to possibly look for more easter eggs. Until then, I'll have my eye on the devs for more titles.

**Score: 5/6**
