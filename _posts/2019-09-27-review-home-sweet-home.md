> Horror Fans Come Home! Episodic by design, so this chapter won't be as fulfilling as you would hope. But it certainly is a great start!

Home Sweet Home is a fairly standard horror walking sim. It stands out by having some solid stealth mechanics that lead to some seriously tense moments within an atmosphere full of dread! Navigating the game gave me the urge to explore, needing to see every little detail put into the game, and there's a lot to unpack. As you go through, you unravel a bleak story of betrayal, distrust, paranoia, crime, and love. Pull on each thread (or burn them) and you find that you can take nothing at face value, and something sinister lurking underneath.

The audio is something that really sells this game for me. It needs work at some points to be sure. The parts where it is done well were some of the best audio I've heard in a horror game. The main ghost seen in the trailer is so well done, I was shitting bricks every time I was in her presence! The music fit the setting and added some nice tension when it was needed.

I had a horrifically good time throughout almost all of the game. With every good comes some bad... and without getting into spoiler territory, the ending is pretty bad and very abrupt. It left me wondering if they chose the right part to end it. It felt like it was trying to be a cliffhanger without really closing any part of the story at all. It just left me feeling like I still didn't have a full grasp on any part of the story in its entirety. I got the sense that there were many layers to the main theme, but haven't got the correlation quite yet. The journey to get there is worth the price of admission. I'm really looking forward to completing the story! 

**Score: 4.5/6**
