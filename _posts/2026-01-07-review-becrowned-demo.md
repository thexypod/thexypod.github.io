Having just finished my playthrough of [Greyhill Incident](https://thexypod.com/review-greyhill-incident), I had some extra time to spare on stream, so I figured a demo would be a good choice. I had featured Becrowned in my video and blog post [66 Upcoming Horror Titles in 2026 & Beyond](https://youtu.be/AiGjTMYBJQs?si=eXJf9uQUqPLT_uQF), and it instantly caught my eye. It doesn’t take much to draw parallels to retro, PS2 era games like Silent Hill and Resident Evil, so it was right in the sweet spot to pique my interest. 

> Since this was just a demo, consider this a mini review. I’m not going to get in too deep here, but the game is shaping up to become one of my most anticipated games coming out in the coming months. 

The demo begins with you taking control of the main character, Richard Torrance, which has got to be a nod to The Shining. He awakes from a nap while on a camping vacation with his wife, Vicky. The first thing he notices is that not only is Vicky missing, but everyone who was initially vacationing in the camp is also missing. In his efforts to piece together what happened, Richard begins his journey.

The first thing you’ll notice in the game is the graphics. They’re retro-inspired, but have taken the style and really shown what it’s capable of in modern day game development. It’s absolutely charming to see it done in this way, and adds so much to the experience, especially if you’re nostalgic for older horror games. 

There’s tank controls and some fixed camera angles. I’ve been critical about fixed camera angles before, but Becrowned definitely utilizes it in a more modern way. It seems it’s more about adding tension than just a convenient placement. Though there were a few times I would've liked to see the environment in my own way. The angle is fixed, but it smoothly follows your character so there isn't anything here taking you out of the game. 

My only gripe with the game (knowing full-well that I’m reviewing a demo) is that the melee combat feels a touch clunky and loose. Each hit both given and received feels passive and I don't think I ever succeeded in using the dodge ability. However, there’s also guns which do feel great! Whichever you choose the combat also features a targeting system which felt natural and made it much easier for precise combat. 

The monsters have a grotesque look about them as you can see from both the trailer and the demo itself. Each design is unique and requires a combat strategy that will likely keep you on your toes. You also encounter a handful of NPCs that have their own style, quirks, and personalities that I think adds to the overall feeling of the game. 

The environment is where this game really stands out. You go from a remote modern camping site, to old Gothic churches, to medieval castles, then back to modern world office buildings. It adds to the intrigue and makes me want to dig into the plot a lot more. There is definitely something ominous happening with Vicky and I'm really looking forward to diving into the story. 

If you’re a fan of any of the classic horror games from PS2, Gamecube, I really think you’re going to appreciate this game. It’s made with heavy inspiration from those titles with love, and I think it really shines through as exactly that. It’s really unique and I think if the rest of the game continues with the same momentum and progression as the demo, I believe it’ll be welcomed into the survival/psychological horror titles as an instant classic.
