When Visage was announced I remember everyone being pretty excited because it was a solid looking analog to P.T. (RIP). I was excited myself and did play the game during early access which only featured 1 chapter out of the 4 that would ultimately release coming out of early access. It was impressive enough to commit to coming back to the house one day, and finally I made that visit...

## Overview
Visage starts out like any other horror game... you're placed in the POV of Dwayne, a man who is in the act of viciously murdering his entire family and then self exiting. You wake up in a strange tiled room with slime or blood on the floor. Having just carried out his malicious act, Dwayne himself is left to discover the sordid past of the house.

The game is broken down into 3 different chapters all of which are events that are only tied together by the house in which they occurred. Lucy, a young girl who is mercilessly tormented by a demon. Dolores, an older woman suffering from dementia and reliving fractured memories of the trauma in child-loss. And Rakan, a stressed out, paranoid man who is interned in a psychiatric hospital and slowly loses himself in the treatment. These chapters all interweave with Dwayne's as you piece it all together.

## Gameplay & Mechanics
Visage plays as your typical walking sim, mixed with various actions and puzzles. It also features a sanity system which is triggered by standing in the dark for too long or witnessing a paranormal event. The effect compounds as the less sanity you have, the more paranormal events you encounter. If you have low sanity for too long, one of the forces in the chapter is likely to manifest and make you it's target. You can counter this by standing in a light source from a fixture or candle, or by taking pills if your sanity has gone passed the point of light being an available aid. The rules of the sanity system feel loose at times as each chapter within the game often have moments that abandon it altogether.

At one point, you will be lost and it will be frustrating. The game leaves something to be desired when it comes to giving you clues and breadcrumbs to follow that ensure you're actually progressing. This, tied with the paranormal events can easily confuse you and leave you wondering if what you saw was a progression event, or just a standard paranormal event. It also doesn't help that the whole house is open and at your disposal the entire time in a game that heavily relies on backtracking and triggered level evolutions to show you that something is meant to be explored... again.

Some of the clues will leave you scratching your head as well. For instance, there is a scribbled eye illustration which you will come to know as the "look here" clue. But the clue doesn't always let you know what you're supposed to be doing. Do you interact with it? Do you stare at it for a couple of seconds without moving? Do you point a camera flash at it? Do you use an item on it? As these are all valid options throughout the game, you'll find yourself jumping through these hoops often trying to simply progress the game.

Visage does it's job in handholding for the most part, but it becomes one of those blink and you'll miss it type of things that will send you aimlessly walking through the house trying to find the next objective. The frustrations will be compounded as some of the events become more of a trail and error experience. In those moments, take a break, or look up the answers because it may not be as obvious as you think they should be.

## Story & Narrative
As you progress through the game and its chapters, you may find the stories are a little disjointed. They feel that way, because they are that way by design. It's only when you have the realization that the house is the only common factor between them that the game's true antagonist is revealed. It seems like the house and its events are fueled by trauma. It is never mentioned why this is the case and how it started, but it may be worth looking at it like this; the house had a traumatic event occur, then another, and another, all snowballing into this field of negative energy feeding on tragedy and yielding dividends.

The game leaves it open to you to determine or discover the order in which you investigate each chapter. The chapters are triggered by picking up miscellaneous items scattered throughout the house that are relevant to each story. It's important to note that Dwayne's storyline is the default for the the game. That is to say that when you're not on a chapter, you're on Dwayne's chapter. Once you've triggered a chapter, all of the clues and things for Dwayne's chapter will temporarily disappear. Unfortunately, that tidbit is left out of the prompt, so if you were in the middle of something, you'll now have to wait until the chapter you began is complete.

Dwayne's story is broken up into almost mini-chapters. You go through each one by finding various items, or interecting with elements in the house. Keep an eye/ear out for these because they can be subtle. Dwayne faces the different aspects of his own life and how he dealt with them in each chapter, and you're rewarded with 1 of 7 pieces of the main quest item on completion.

## Experience & Atmosphere
Visage gets **huge** points in this category. This will be one of the most atmospheric and horrifying games you will ever experience. Aside from the story itself which contains greatly disturbing elements and has some seriously tense moments, the paranormal events are equally as unsettling. You will get chased, stabbed, choked, and haunted and smile throughout as a horror fan.

The paranormal events are designed to scare the shit out of you at every turn. Walking through parts the darkened house with only a lighter illuminating your way will trigger something completely different than if you had the lights on. Little details have been sprinkled throughout the game and will have you second guessing your every move.

Most importantly, the house feels lived in and haunted. There's a constant sense of unease with every corner you turn, every room you enter. You just really never know what to expect and every encounter brings a new experience of scares. There are personal items scattered throughout the house that give it a story as well.

## Audio
All of the audio is meticulously designed to get deep under your skin. The effects on the disembodied voices, the reverberations in long hallways or caverns, the impact of sledge hammers are all immersive and give you the sense that you are in the game. Headphones are **highly recommended** as the scares are either right in your face, or subtle whispers in the distance.

Music plays a big part of the horror and for it's mostly classical score, it hits the horror nerve well and will keep you on your toes throughout. Much of the voice acting is very well done in this game and there isn't a time that'll leave you thinking that they went cheaper on hiring the actors. All in all, no issues with the audio and it adds a lot to the immersion and horror of the game.

> I had my issues with the game to be sure, but the horror in this game is just too damn good to be ignored.

## Verdict
In my recent review of [Greyhill Incident](https://thexypod.com/review-greyhill-incident) I said I wanted to rate it higher because of the originality and subject mattter. With Visage, I want to rate it lower because of some of the frustrations I encountered, but really, the horror in this game is just **too damn good** to be ignored. I had my issues with the game to be sure, it's just that in this case the juice is absolutely worth the squeeze. I personally found myself in a perpetual state of goosebumps which was topped off with traditional jumpscares and atmospheric dread.

On my 4th and final stream of the game I had set a rule that if I was stuck for more than 10 minutes on a part of the game, I would look up only what was needed to progress. [Here's](https://www.neoseeker.com/visage-2020/walkthrough) the guide that I used for those points should you need them. I don't typically take this approach with video games, but Visage had this way of making me feel utterly lost and I spent upwards of 45 minutes at times looking in the wrong place for the answer.

Aside from that, it's an easy recommendation for horror game fans. This game is terrifying and if you haven't already played or watched it, you should dive right in and see what all the fuss is about. If it was the analog for P.T. we'll never know how it compared. As a standalone experience, it more than exceeded my expectations.

**Score: 5/6**
