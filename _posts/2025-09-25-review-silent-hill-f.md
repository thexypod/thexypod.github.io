I think we were all waiting with bated breath for this one. The trailer was dropped with Konami’s Silent Hill Transmission, back in October of 2022, which was when they announced that they were reviving the franchise with a series of releases coming over the following years. It immediately stood out from the other releases because while it was a Silent Hill game, it didn’t have the setting of the abandoned American city we’ve all come to know and love. And while there was fog, there was something else… something organic carpeting the town which now had a traditional Japan setting from the 1960s. My computer is a little dated now, so I had to borrow a friend’s PS5 to play this one. I was excited, completely unaware of the journey ahead. So how did it pan out? 

> This is a long one as Silent Hill holds a special place in my heart... so strap in.

## Overview
Silent Hill f is developed and published by Konami. It’s as if they finally saw the success that Resident Evil was having with their reboots and new titles and wanted another slice of that survival horror pie. Because let’s be honest, no one asked for the Silent Hill pachinko machines. You play as Hinako Shimizu who is navigating her way through the town of Ebisugaoka as she discovers it is pretty much entirely abandoned. Naturally she sets out to find some answers only to find that the town is vacant of human beings, and in their place are grotesque creatures who will attack anything that moves. So far so good, it’s got the Silent Hill vibes flowing and you’re excited to see how they’re going to tie this game into the rest of the series. It definitely plays like a Silent Hill game… wait, you’ve got a dodge ability? This game is definitely flirting with the line between a standard survival horror and an action-horror.

## Gameplay & Mechanics
Prior Silent Hill titles have been criticized for how clunky the combat system is, and for good reason. With Silent Hill f, it seems to have been brought into the light with the aforementioned dodge ability and a leveling system which solely focuses on combat improvement. Encounters with enemies have more weight to them and feel more like a localized fight than a random interaction in an open world. You’ll get subtle hints that a dodgable attack is imminent and it’s up to you to time your dodge perfectly to avoid damage. This makes Silent Hill f stand out amongst the other games, and would’ve been a welcome addition if not for what they did with the weapons themselves.

One aspect of the combat that’ll have you frustrated and questioning Konami’s choices is the weapon degradation system. Instead of finding your trusty plank or pipe (or chainsaw) and using it for the remainder of the game, you instead are required to keep an eye out for either repair kit, or the items themselves as you watch the condition level drop with each encounter. Enemies outweigh the weapon availability, so it’s almost as if the game is punishing you for choosing combat over stealth or just plain running from fights. At times it makes you wonder why this mechanic was even added to the game to begin with because it really doesn’t add much to the game except as a time sink and an excuse to level the weapon degradation up.

Throughout the game you enter the “other-realm” where suddenly your weapons no longer have durability. You’ll find those sections much more enjoyable and a good spot to practice the combat they spent so much time refining. Though the enemies are different here, the core combat mechanic remains the same. The other-realm also happens to be where the majority of the boss fights occur. The boss fights are mostly well done, though you may find some additional frustrations with the attack recovery and stun lock mechanics leading to some undeserved deaths.

This is a good spot to bring up another major frustration point in the ending. No spoilers here in terms of plot, but the ending culminates all of the combat frustration as you’re forced to deal with literal hordes of enemies in order to progress to the main confrontation. It would’ve been awesome to take one of the weapons from the other-realm into the real-world for this exact moment, but alas, it wasn’t meant to be (at least on the first and only playthrough I did). At the very least, the controls on the PS5 were pretty responsive and you’ll find yourself getting the hang of them as you progress through the game.

Puzzles make their expected return, and while most of them were done well enough, you may find some of them more confusing than others. One particular one in the farm field has been a frustration point for many players. You’re shown a scarecrow with a should-be familiar quote and surrounded by frozen entities you can inspect. The goal seems simple: match the quote to the right figure and pull the plug to move on, with a wrong choice triggering an attack. The issue? Every entity looks almost identical, making the “puzzle” more guesswork than logic, and thanks to the weapon degradation system, you can’t brute-force your way through it. It comes off as clever on paper, but all these things combined make it disappointing and frustrating. Luckily it’s the only one that stands out as needs-improvement. The other puzzles are fairly similar to any other survival horror game.

The pacing of Silent Hill f isn’t bad at all. From the beginning of the game on, it ramps up the encounters in a meaningful way. Each section feels complete as you bounce from the real-world to the other-world. You may find that the plotline gets a little convoluted as you bounce between the realms. The stories try their best to intertwine but ultimately get lost in the constant shifting. If you’re taking notes, it’s likely you’ll follow the story enough to get by. 

## Story & Narrative
As stated, the game begins in Ebisugaoka, which is the host to many of Hinako’s memories. It’s situated at the bottom of a mountain and has rural farm areas surrounding the otherwise busy downtown core. The town is beautifully designed and has a good deal of places to explore. Then there’s the other-realm which is much more open, though dark. The other-realm doesn’t appear to be connected to [town name] geographically, but it still fits the overall theme of the game.

The entire plot revolves around our protagonist, Hinako, who’s in the center of the expectations of everyone around her. Her parents are in massive debt and are relying on the arranged marriage of Hinako to dig them out. They have a dysfunctional relationship… her father is a terrible, abusive person and Hinako resents her mother for being passive about that. Hinako’s friends are there to add context, but they’re no better. Shu, who is Hinako’s best friend and platonic “partner”, is resentful about the arranged marriage. Rinko is jealous of Shu and Hinako’s bond and is actively attempting to split them up throughout the game both metaphorically and physically. Only Fox Mask seems to truly be on Hinako’s side… even if he is a little overbearing and you’re continuously being warned by your childhood doll telling you not to trust him.

The game plays on these relationship themes as you’re given tidbits of information between enemy encounters with the odd note here and there to explain things further. Apparently, some of these notes and items that add to the story are locked into a second playthrough, which is a pretty unconventional way to promote replayability. Players should be rewarded for exploration, especially on a first playthrough. This may leave you feeling like your first playthrough feeling a bit shallow. Your first playthrough is pretty much guaranteed to get a standard ending making it a pretty linear experience. For a game that’s only about 8ish hours long, a full price tag may set you back a bit, but it’s already starting to go on sale on Steam.

## Experience & Atmosphere
Alright, here’s where Silent Hill f really shines. They absolutely nailed the atmosphere of the game. While you may feel there are aspects of the environment and world that could be lost on anyone who doesn’t know about Japanese customs/culture, it's not enough to detract from the overall horror experience of Silent Hill f. The town has a liminal quality to it as what should be a bustling area is devoid of all signs of life. This leaves you with the feeling of isolation and amplifies the dread when the monsters start appearing. The iconic fog definitely leaves you feeling claustrophobic as it keeps you guessing what’s just ahead, let alone what’s around the corner.

The monsters and bosses have very distinct features and are probably the strongest aspect of SHf. Whether they represent our protagonist's emotions as SHf’s predecessors have is a little ambiguous, at least for the first playthrough. You won’t have moments like when James tells Pyramid Head that he needed him to punish him for his sins. Though each monster is strongly designed, just as it is in other SH games, you’ll find the diversity a touch underwhelming as each new area is populated with basically the same enemies. There is room for improvement when it comes to variation. To make up for it, they each have their own unique style with unsettling and unnatural movements and noises.

## Audio

The audio brings the world and the monsters to life. There isn’t a time in SHf where you’ll be taken out of the world or distracted by the audio. The monsters have their own sounds that may fill you with dread just knowing they’re nearby. The unnatural movement is complemented by bones cracking and tendons ripping to accommodate these movements. The world around you comes alive and breathes with environmental sounds such as wind blowing, floors creaking, random footsteps… not to mention all the squelching from the organic flower growth occurring throughout the town. Though you might find it a little jarring as ALL audio stops when you check your map. Depending on your preference, you may choose to have the original voiceovers in japanese, or the dubbed english version-both of which are well done.

The music, another installment done by Akira Yamaoka, is definitely fitting for the geographic location. While it’s a fantastic soundtrack that adds a lot to the game, it’s not quite as iconic as some of the previous titles. Though it certainly has its own personality. It picks up the pace precisely when it needs to in battles and seamlessly blends traditional Japanese instruments with the industrial distortion that made the series soundtrack unique. It really adds a good dimension to the game and should keep you engrossed throughout.

## Verdict
Silent Hill f has many strengths and few weaknesses as it stands for a horror game. It’s a triple A game and plays like one. There were very few bugs I encountered and many of the elements in the game met or exceeded my expectations. There were moments that I felt were jarring, out of place, and downright silly for a Silent Hill game (more on that in my rant below). As I said in the beginning, my computer is a little below the minimum requirements, so once that’s updated, I am likely to buy and play this again. I like the system of keeping your starts between playthroughs making each one a little easier and I do want to experience the multiple endings myself at some point. So if you’re a fan of body/survival/japan/horror, I believe you would enjoy this game whether you're a SH fan or not.

**Score: 5/6**

## Extra Rant
Look, I know this is a hot button issue and very divisive, but SHf is just not a SH game to me. I read what others have said about it and while I fully grasp their comparison, there isn’t much that could persuade me that this wasn’t an independent IP that just had SH slapped on it. Would I have played it without the title? Yes, but I probably wouldn’t have gone out of my way to experience it on day one had I known what this game actually was about. SH is hardly the only IP guilty of this. Cloverfield anthology is a good example of using the name to rile up the fan base despite having absolutely nothing to do with the source material.

So yeah, I feel a touch duped.  Here’s how I view the similarities: there’s an abandoned town with monsters, there’s fog, it deals with psychological trauma. That’s about as far as it goes. I mean, this can’t be the basis for an SH game, right? I get it, SH4 The Room was the same thing, hell even minus the fog. But honestly that doesn’t really fit for me either.

The differences between the games is where I make my judgement. Hinako wasn’t beckoned to the town by some supernatural force, it manifests itself for her to become the place to face her demons. There wasn’t really anything for her to atone for, or regrets she needed to face, it was more a decision that she was in the middle of. The other-world is not a distorted, rusted version of the town, it’s just another realm. The flowers that carpet the town are literally everywhere and not akin to the dark world of previous titles. The fog <span class="spoiler">was never a character before, merely a characteristic. SHf turns it into one. </span> And finally prior to SHf, the main character <span class="spoiler"> was never imbued with supernatural powers. </span> It feels completely out of place and would play well for any other horror game, just not in the SH series. I could go on, but you probably get the point.

This is where the divisiveness comes in. You might have an excellent experience with this game and it may feel entirely like a SH game to you. If that’s the case, I wouldn’t hold it against you or say my opinion is more valid than yours. I’m including this portion because it’s something I would’ve liked to have read prior to playing. There are absolutely themes within SHf that play to the same beats as prior SH titles, but really you could draw the same conclusions with many horror games if that’s your only basis.
