> One part Minecraft, one part Fallout series, one part Left 4 Dead = 7 Days to die!

In just over a week I have easily dumped over 100 hours into this game with lots of positive things to say. The exploration factor is fantastic: The procedurally generated maps are very large and take days (both in game and IRL) to explore in their entirety. The addition of the "war fog" means you never quite know what you're getting into. Explore different biomes each with unique prefab areas of interest. The loot and crafting systems are great and accessible in the way that it's easy to understand and makes sense most of the time. Leveling feels balanced and you feel how powerful you can get over time (a lesson learned from restarting and remember where it all starts). It's a sandbox game that truly feels sandbox in that there are very few limitations to what you can do/build. Highly customizable characters with all the different clothing and skill sets. Level 200 cap here, just FYI.

My only cons are that the graphics are a bit lacklustre and at some times the combat (and even the game in general) feel clunky and cumbersome. Riding the minibike sometimes feels like you're skipping along instead of driving. It definitely doesn't have the most innovative combat system, and fighting tends to get a bit repetitive. As for the graphics, I referenced the Fallout series, and if you think New Vegas without the texture enhancements, that's what you're getting here. But hey, if Minecraft without shaders is any kind of benchmark for sandbox games, well... this is better than that. lol

Is it worth it? Well, if you like sandbox games with looting, crafting, levelling, then I wouldn't pass this game up. For the price you're definitely getting your time's worth whether it is on sale or not. If it is, then for me that is an absolute resounding YES!

Edit: Just wanted to add that many of the cons have since been updated and aren't nearly as glaring as they used to be. Despite being in "alpha" for 10 years, I consider this game pretty polished.
