Hi! I’m Xy — like xylophone, but louder and with way more screaming.
Canadian, father, husband, and gamer raised on Doom, Wolfenstein, and late-night horror marathons (both games and movies 😈). I play games that make my heart race and my chat laugh. I chase jump scares for fun now. Expect bad decisions, good vibes, and the occasional panic scream. I stream 100% horror games on [Twitch](https://twitch.com/TheXyPod) and [YouTube](https://youtube.com/@TheXyPod?sub_confirmation=1) and this site serves as a repository for my reviews of these games as well as all the freshest news I can find.

## Reviews

All reviews featured on this site will contain minimal spoilers. Any spoilers relating to the game or if I've referred to other game spoilers in a review, it will contain a spoiler black-out which will be clickable to reveal. It will look like this (click or tap to reveal): <span class="spoiler">This is a spoiler and it is covered so you don't accidentally read it.</span>

Before you jump into my reviews, it’s probably a good idea to understand where my expectations come from and how I determine what makes a good horror game to me. I grew up as a cis hetero male dressed head to toe in black, caked in pale foundation, and dark eyeliner, listening to Nine Inch Nails and Marilyn Manson. Often watching horror movies in my spare time with friends as it complimented much of the music we were listening to at the time.

I was also suffering from depression and derealization in my teens and found a weird solace in Silent Hill 2. Something about the isolation and surreal setting resonated with me and really set a tone that kept ringing throughout my enjoyment of many games in movies. I tend to gravitate towards movies and video games that have more of a creepy feeling and rely on atmosphere and eeriness. Surreal settings and storylines are a huge plus (think Guillermo del Toro and David Lynch) I love a good jumpscare, but if it’s overdone and the sole focus of the game, it’s a huge turn off for me.

## News

I’m really trying my best to stay on top of the latest news in horror games. I’m just one guy, so I don’t have a big team behind me, but I comb through Discord, forums, developer blogs, and social media to bring you the most interesting updates. Horror games have always fascinated me, from the tense atmosphere to the clever storytelling, and sharing this news is something I genuinely love doing. While I can’t cover every headline, I focus on the stories I think fans will actually want to read... whether that’s upcoming releases, indie gems, or updates to classic favorites. I also love hearing from readers! If you spot something I’ve missed, your tips can help make this dark little corner of the web better for everyone who loves horror games.

I do all this on my own, on my lunch breaks, late nights after work, and whenever I can steal a quiet moment, fueled by curiosity, a love for horror games, and the satisfaction of uncovering something new. It may not be flashy or glamorous, but it’s honest, and I hope that dedication comes through in every post.
